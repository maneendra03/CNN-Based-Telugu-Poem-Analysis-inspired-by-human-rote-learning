    "text": "I\n\nThe clearest eyes in all the world they read\nWith sense more keen and spirit of sight more true\nThan burns and thrills in sunrise, when the dew\nFlames, and absorbs the glory round it shed,\nAs they the light of ages quick and dead,\nClosed now, forsake us: yet the shaft that slew\nCan slay not one of all the works we knew,\nNor death discrown that many-laurelled head.\n\nThe works of words whose life seems lightning wrought,\nAnd moulded of unconquerable thought,\nAnd quickened with imperishable flame,\nStand fast and shine and smile, assured that nought\nMay fade of all their myriad-moulded fame,\nNor England's memory clasp not Browning's name.\n\nII\n\nDeath, what hast thou to do with one for whom\nTime is not lord, but servant? What least part\nOf all the fire that fed his living heart,\nOf all the light more keen that sundawn's bloom\nThat lit and led his spirit, strong as doom\nAnd bright as hope, can aught thy breath may dart\nQuench? Nay, thou knowest he knew thee what thou art,\nA shadow born of terror's barren womb,\nThat brings not forth save shadows. What art thou,\nTo dream, albeit thou breathe upon his brow,\nThat power on him is given thee,—that thy breath\nCan make him less than love acclaims him now,\nAnd hears all time sound back the word it saith?\nWhat part hast thou then in his glory, Death?\n\nIII\n\nA graceless doom it seems that bids us grieve:\nVenice and winter, hand in deadly hand,\nHave slain the lover of her sunbright strand\nAnd singer of a stormbright Christmas Eve.\nA graceless guerdon we that loved receive\nFor all our love, from that the dearest land\nLove worshipped ever. Blithe and soft and bland,\nToo fair for storm to scathe or fire to cleave,\nShone on our dreams and memories evermore\nThe domes, the towers, the mountains and the shore\nThat gird or guard thee, Venice: cold and black\nSeems now the face we loved as he of yore.\nWe have given thee love—no stint, no stay, no lack:\nWhat gift, what gift is this thou hast given us back?\n\nIV\n\nBut he—to him, who knows what gift is thine,\nDeath? Hardly may we think or hope, when we\nPass likewise thither where to-night is he,\nBeyond the irremeable outer seas that shine\nAnd darken round such dreams as half divine\nSome sunlit harbour in that starless sea\nWhere gleams no ship to windward or to lee,\nTo read with him the secret of thy shrine.\n\nThere too, as here, may song, delight, and love,\nThe nightingale, the sea-bird, and the dove,\nFulfil with joy the splendour of the sky\nTill all beneath wax bright as all above:\nBut none of all that search the heavens, and try\nThe sun, may match the sovereign eagle's eye.\n\nV\n\nAmong the wondrous ways of men and time\nHe went as one that ever found and sought\nAnd bore in hand the lamp-like spirit of thought\nTo illume with instance of its fire sublime\nThe dusk of many a cloudlike age and clime.\nNo spirit in shape of light and darkness wrought,\nNo faith, no fear, no dream, no rapture, nought\nThat blooms in wisdom, nought that burns in crime,\nNo virtue girt and armed and helmed with light,\nNo love more lovely than the snows are white,\nNo serpent sleeping in some dead soul's tomb,\nNo song-bird singing from some live soul's height,\nBut he might hear, interpret, or illume\nWith sense invasive as the dawn of doom.\n\nVI\n\nWhat secret thing of splendour or of shade\nSurmised in all those wandering ways wherein\nMan, led of love and life and death and sin,\nStrays, climbs, or cowers, allured, absorbed, afraid,\nMight not the strong and sunlike sense invade\nOf that full soul that had for aim to win\nLight, silent over time's dark toil and din,\nLife, at whose touch death fades as dead things fade?\nO spirit of man, what mystery moves in thee\nThat he might know not of in spirit, and see\nThe heart within the heart that seems to strive,\nThe life within the life that seems to be,\nAnd hear, through all thy storms that whirl and drive,\nThe living sound of all men's souls alive?\n\nVII\n\nHe held no dream worth waking: so he said,\nHe who stands now on death's triumphal steep,\nAwakened out of life wherein we sleep\nAnd dream of what he knows and sees, being dead.\nBut never death for him was dark or dread:\n\"Look forth\" he bade the soul, and fear not. Weep,\nAll ye that trust not in his truth, and keep\nVain memory's vision of a vanished head\nAs all that lives of all that once was he\nSave that which lightens from his word: but we,\nWho, seeing the sunset-coloured waters roll,\nYet know the sun subdued not of the sea,\nNor weep nor doubt that still the spirit is whole,\nAnd life and death but shadows of the soul.",

I am uneasy at heart when I have to leave my accustomed shelter; I forgot that there abides the old in the new, and that there also thou abidest.\n\nThrough birth and death, in this world or in others, wherever thou leadest me it is thou, the same, the one companion of my endless life who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar. When one knows thee, then alien there is none, then no door is shut. Oh, grant me my prayer that I may never lose the bliss of the touch of the One in the play of the many.\n\nii\n\nNo more noisy, loud words from me, such is my master’s will. Hence-forth I deal in whispers. The speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song.\n\nMen hasten to the King’s market. All the buyers and sellers are there. But I have my untimely leave in the middle of the day, in the thick of work.\nLet then the flowers come out in my garden, though it is not their time, and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum.\n\nFull many an hour have I spent in the strife of the good and the evil, but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him, and I know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequence!\n\niii\n\nOn the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and I knew it not. My basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded.\n\nOnly now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange smell in the south wind.\n\nThat vague fragrance made my heart ache with longing, and it seemed to me that it was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion.\n\nI knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and this perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart.\n\niv\n\n\nBy all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world. But it is otherwise with thy love, which is greater than theirs, and thou keepest me free. Lest I forget them they never venture to leave me alone. But day passes by after day and thou are not seen.\n\nIf I call not thee in my prayers, if I keep not thee in my heart—thy love for me still waits for my love.\n\nv\n\n\nI was not aware of the moment when I first crossed the threshold of this life. What was the power that made me open out into this vast mystery like a bud in the forest at midnight? When in the morning I looked upon the light I felt in a moment that I was no stranger in this world, that the inscrutable without name and form had taken me in its arms in the form of my own mother. Even so, in death the same unknown will appear as ever known to me. And because I love this life, I know I shall love death as well. The child cries out when from the right breast the mother takes it away to find in the very next moment its consolation in the left one.\n\nvi\n\nThou art the sky and thou art the nest as well. Oh, thou beautiful, there in the nest it is thy love that encloses the soul with colors and sounds and odors. There comes the morning with the golden basket in her right hand bearing the wreath of beauty, silently to crown the earth. And there comes the evening over the lonely meadows deserted by herds, through trackless paths, carrying cool draughts of peace in her golden pitcher from the western ocean of rest.\n\nBut there, where spreads the infinite sky for the soul to take her flight in, reigns the stainless white radiance. There is no day nor night, nor form nor color, and never never a word.\n\nOriginally appeared in the\nDecember\n1912\nissue of Poetry magazine.",

Far beneath,\nchickens daintily pause and move\nunseen in the yard of the tumbledown\nfarmstead, chipmunks blend with the heath.\n\nNow adrift on the airflow, unfurled, alone,\nall that he glimpses—the hills’ lofty, ragged\nridges, the silver stream that threads\nquivering like a living bone\nof steel, badly notched with rapids,\nthe townships like strings of beads\n\nstrewn across New England. Having slid down to nil\nthermometers—those household gods in niches—\nfreeze, inhibiting thus the fire\nof leaves and churches’ spires. Still,\nno churches for him. In the windy reaches,\nundreamt of by the most righteous choir,\n\nhe soars in a cobalt-blue ocean, his beak clamped shut,\nhis talons clutched tight into his belly\n—claws balled up like a sunken fist—\nsensing in each wisp of down the thrust\nfrom below, glinting back the berry\nof his eyeball, heading south-southeast\n\nto the Rio Grande, the Delta, the beech groves and farther still:\nto a nest hidden in the mighty groundswell\nof grass whose edges no fingers trust,\nsunk amid forest’s odors, filled\nwith splinters of red-speckled eggshell,\nwith a brother or a sister’s ghost.\n\nThe heart overgrown with flesh, down, feather, wing,\npulsing at feverish rate, nonstopping,\npropelled by internal heat and sense,\nthe bird goes slashing and scissoring\nthe autumnal blue, yet by the same swift token,\nenlarging it at the expense\n\nof its brownish speck, barely registering on the eye,\na dot, sliding far above the lofty\npine tree; at the expense of the empty look\nof that child, arching up at the sky,\nthat couple that left the car and lifted\ntheir heads, that woman on the stoop.\n\nBut the uprush of air is still lifting him\nhigher and higher.

Yet it’s their total within his sight\nthat tells the bird of his elevation,\nof what altitude he’s reached this trip.\nWhat am I doing at such a height?\nHe senses a mixture of trepidation\nand pride. Heeling over a tip\n\nof wing, he plummets down. But the resilient air\nbounces him back, winging up to glory,\nto the colorless icy plane.\nHis yellow pupil darts a sudden glare\nof rage, that is, a mix of fury\nand terror. So once again\n\nhe turns and plunges down. But as walls return\nrubber balls, as sins send a sinner to faith, or near,\nhe’s driven upward this time as well!\nHe! whose innards are still so warm!\nStill higher! Into some blasted ionosphere!\nThat astronomically objective hell\n\nof birds that lacks oxygen, and where the milling stars\nplay millet served from a plate or a crescent.\nWhat, for the bipeds, has always meant\nheight, for the feathered is the reverse.\nNot with his puny brain but with shriveled air sacs\nhe guesses the truth of it: it’s the end.\n\nAnd at this point he screams. From the hooklike beak\nthere tears free of him and flies ad luminem\nthe sound Erinyes make to rend\nsouls: a mechanical, intolerable shriek,\nthe shriek of steel that devours aluminum;\n“mechanical,” for it’s meant\n\nfor nobody, for no living ears:\nnot man’s, not yelping foxes’,\nnot squirrels’ hurrying to the ground\nfrom branches; not for tiny field mice whose tears\ncan’t be avenged this way, which forces\nthem into their burrows. And only hounds\n\nlift up their muzzles. A piercing, high-pitched squeal,\nmore nightmarish than the D-sharp grinding\nof the diamond cutting glass,\nslashes the whole sky across. And the world seems to reel\nfor an instant, shuddering from this rending.\nFor the warmth burns space in the highest as\n\nbadly as some iron fence down here\nbrands incautious gloveless fingers.\nWe, standing where we are, exclaim\n“There!” and see far above the tear\nthat is a hawk, and hear the sound that lingers\nin wavelets, a spider skein\n\nswelling notes in ripples across the blue vault of space\nwhose lack of echo spells, especially in October,\nan apotheosis of pure sound.\nAnd caught in this heavenly patterned lace,\nstarlike, spangled with hoarfrost powder,\nsilver-clad, crystal-bound,\n\nthe bird sails to the zenith, to the dark-blue high\nof azure. Through binoculars we foretoken\nhim, a glittering dot, a pearl.\nWe hear something ring out in the sky,\nlike some family crockery being broken,\nslowly falling aswirl,\n\nyet its shards, as they reach our palms, don’t hurt\nbut melt when handled. And in a twinkling\nonce more one makes out curls, eyelets, strings,\nrainbowlike, multicolored, blurred\ncommas, ellipses, spirals, linking\nheads of barley, concentric rings—\n\nthe bright doodling pattern the feather once possessed,\na map, now a mere heap of flying\npale flakes that make a green slope appear\nwhite.

Expect to hear a lot\nabout erotic consummation inferred\nby laburnum gyrations and bamboo\nsyncopations. Listen to the racket\nof wide-mouthed frogs and bent-\nlegged prawns going about their\nbusiness of mating while rain falls\nand falls on tiled roofs and verandas,\ncourtyards, pagodas. Because such\na big part of you seeks to understand\nthis kind of rain — so unlike your cold\nrain, austere rain, get-me-the-hell-\nout-of-here rain. Rain that can’t fathom\nhow to liberate camphor from the vaults\nof the earth. Let me tell you how little\nis written of mud, how it sneaks up\nlike a sleek-gilled vandal to catch hold\nof your ankles. Or about the restorative\nproperties of mosquito blood, dappled\nand fried against the wires of a bug-zapping\npaddle.

Now sip on your masala tea,\nput your lips to the sweet, spicy skin\nof it. There’s more to see — notice\nthe dogs who’ve been fucking on the beach,\nlocked in embrace like an elongated Anubis,\nthe crabs scavenging the flesh of a dopey-\neyed ponyfish, the entire delirious coast\nwith its philtra of beach and saturnine\nclouds arched backwards in disbelief.\nAnd the mayflies who swarm in November\nwith all their ephemeral grandeur to die\nin millions at the behest of light, the geckos\nstationed on living room walls, cramming\nfistfuls of wings in their maws. Notice\nhow hardly anyone mentions the word\ndeath, even though the fridge leaks\nand the sheets have been damp for weeks.\nAnd in this helter-skelter multitude\nof gray-greenness, notice how even the rain\nbegins to feel fatigued. The roads and sewers\nhave nowhere to go, and like old-fashioned pursuers\nthey wander and spill their babbling hearts\nto electrical poles and creatures with ears.\nAnd what happens later, you might ask,\nafter we’ve moved to a place of shelter,\nwhen the cracks in the earth have reappeared?\nWe dream of wet, of course, of being submerged\nin millet stalks, of webbed toes and stalled\nclocks and eels in the mouth of a heron.\nWe forget how unforgivably those old poems\nled us to believe that men were mountains,\nthat the beautiful could never remain\nheartbroken, that when the rains arrive\nwe should be delighted to be taken\nin drowning, in devotion.",

    "text": "Some days I catch a rhythm, almost a song\nin my own breath. I'm alone here\nin Brooklyn Heights, late morning, the sky\nabove the St. George Hotel clear, clear\nfor New York, that is. The radio playing\n\"Bird Flight,\" Parker in his California\ntragic voice fifty years ago, his faltering\n\"Lover Man\" just before he crashed into chaos.\nI would guess that outside the recording studio\nin Burbank the sun was high above the jacarandas,\nit was late March, the worst of yesterday's rain\nhad come and gone, the sky washed blue. Bird\ncould have seen for miles if he'd looked, but what\nhe saw was so foreign he clenched his eyes,\nshook his head, and barked like a dog—just once—\nand then Howard McGhee took his arm and assured him\nhe'd be OK. I know this because Howard told me\nyears later that he thought Bird could\nlie down in the hotel room they shared, sleep\nfor an hour or more, and waken as himself.\nThe perfect sunlight angles into my little room\nabove Willow Street. I listen to my breath\ncome and go and try to catch its curious taste,\npart milk, part iron, part blood, as it passes\nfrom me into the world. This is not me,\nthis is automatic, this entering and exiting,\nmy body's essential occupation without which\nI am a thing. The whole process has a name,\na word I don't know, an elegant word not\nin English or Yiddish or Spanish, a word\nthat means nothing to me. Howard truly believed\nwhat he said that day when he steered\nParker into a cab and drove the silent miles\nbeside him while the bright world\nunfurled around them: filling stations, stands\nof fruits and vegetables, a kiosk selling trinkets\nfrom Mexico and the Philippines. It was all\nso actual and Western, it was a new creation\ncoming into being, like the music of Charlie Parker\nsomeone later called \"glad,\" though that day\nI would have said silent, \"the silent music\nof Charlie Parker.\" Howard said nothing.\nHe paid the driver and helped Bird up two flights\nto their room, got his boots off, and went out\nto let him sleep as the afternoon entered\nthe history of darkness. I'm not judging\nHoward, he did better than I could have\nnow or then. Then I was 19, working\non the loading docks at Railway Express,\ncoming day by day into the damaged body\nof a man while I sang into the filthy air\nthe Yiddish drinking songs my Zadie taught me\nbefore his breath failed. Now Howard is gone,\neleven long years gone, the sweet voice silenced.\n\"The subtle bridge between Eldridge and Navarro,\"\nthey later wrote, all that rising passion\na footnote to others. I remember in '85\nwalking the halls of Cass Tech, the high school\nwhere he taught after his performing days,\nwhen suddenly he took my left hand in his\ntwo hands to tell me it all worked out\nfor the best. Maybe he'd gotten religion,\nmaybe he knew how little time was left,\nmaybe that day he was just worn down\nby my questions about Parker. To him Bird\nwas truly Charlie Parker, a man, a silent note\ngoing out forever on the breath of genius\nwhich now I hear soaring above my own breath\nas this bright morning fades into afternoon.\nMusic, I'll call it music. It's what we need\nas the sun staggers behind the low gray clouds\nblowing relentlessly in from that nameless ocean,\nthe calm and endless one I've still to cross.",

The dance: hands touching, leaves touching—eyes looking, clouds rising—lips touching, cheeks touching, arm about . . . Sleep. Heavy head, heavy arm, heavy dream—: Of Ymir’s flesh the earth was made and of his thoughts were all the gloomy clouds created. Oya!\n\n________________\nOut of bitterness itself the clear wine of the imagination will be pressed and the dance prosper thereby.\n\n2\n\nTo you! whoever you are, wherever you are! (But I know where you are!) There’s Dürer’s “Nemesis” naked on her sphere over the little town by the river—except she’s too old. There’s a dancing burgess by Tenier and Villon’s maitresse—after he’d gone bald and was skin pocked and toothless: she that had him ducked in the sewage drain. Then there’s that miller’s daughter of “buttocks broad and breastes high.” Something of Nietzsche, something of the good Samaritan, something of the devil himself,—can cut a caper of a fashion, my fashion! Hey you, the dance! Squat. leap. Hips to the left. Chin—ha!—sideways! Stand up, stand up ma bonne! you’ll break my backbone. So again!—and so forth till we’re sweat soaked.\n\n________________\nSome fools once were listening to a poet reading hispoem. It so happened that the words of the thing spoke ofgross matters of the everyday world such as are nevermuch hidden from a quick eye. Out of these semblances,and borrowing certain members from fitting masterpiecesof antiquity, the poet began piping up his music, simplefellow, thinking to please his listeners. But they gettingthe whole matter sadly muddled in their minds made sucha confused business of listening that not only were theynot pleased at the poet’s exertions but no sooner had hedone than they burst out against him with violent imprecations.\n\n3\n\nIt’s all one. Richard worked years to conquer the descending cadence, idiotic sentimentalist. Ha, for happiness! This tore the dress in ribbons from her maid’s back and not spared the nails either; wild anger spit from her pinched eyes! This is the better part. Or a child under a table to be dragged out coughing and biting, eyes glittering evilly. I’ll have it my way! Nothing is any pleasure but misery and brokenness. THIS is the only up-cadence. This is where the secret rolls over and opens its eyes. Bitter words spoken to a child ripple in morning light! Boredom from a bedroom doorway thrills with anticipation! The complaints of an old man dying piecemeal are starling chirrups. Coughs go singing on springtime paths across a field; corruption picks strawberries and slow warping of the mind, blacking the deadly walls—counted and recounted—rolls in the grass and shouts ecstatically. All is solved! The moaning and dull sobbing of infants sets blood tingling and eyes ablaze to listen. Speed sings in the heels at long nights tossing on coarse sheets with bruning sockets staring into the black. Dance! Sing! Coil and uncoil! Whip yourselves about! Shout the deliverance! An old woman has infected her blossomy grand-daughter with a blood illness that every two weeks drives the mother into hidden songs of agony, the pad-footed mirage of creeping death for music. The face muscles keep pace. Then a darting about the compass in a tarantelle that wears flesh from bones. Here is dancing! The mind in tatters. And so the music wistfully takes the lead.Ay de m í, Juana la Loca, reina de Espa ña, esa est á tucanta, reina mía!",

Pomfret. London.\nThe voice fragrant with mannered humility,\nWith an equable contempt for this world,\n‘In honorem Trinitatis’. Crash. The head\nStruck down into a meaty conduit of blood.\nSo these dispose themselves to receive each\nPentecostal blow from axe or seraph,\nSpattering block-straw with mortal residue.\nPsalteries whine through the empyrean. Fire\nFlares in the pit, ghosting upon stone\nCreatures of such rampant state, vacuous\nCeremony of possession, restless\nHabitation, no man’s dwelling-place.\n\n\n2\n\nFor whom do we scrape our tribute of pain—\nFor none but the ritual king? We meditate\nA rueful mystery; we are dying\nTo satisfy fat Caritas, those\nWiped jaws of stone. (Suppose all reconciled\nBy silent music; imagine the future\nFlashed back at us, like steel against sun,\nUltimate recompense.) Recall the cold\nOf Towton on Palm Sunday before dawn,\nWakefield, Tewkesbury: fastidious trumpets\nShrilling into the ruck; some trampled\nAcres, parched, sodden or blanched by sleet,\nStuck with strange-postured dead. Recall the wind’s\nFlurrying, darkness over the human mire.\n\n\n3\n\nThey bespoke doomsday and they meant it by\nGod, their curved metal rimming the low ridge.\nBut few appearances are like this. Once\nEvery five hundred years a comet’s\nOver-riding stillness might reveal men\nIn such array, livid and featureless,\nWith England crouched beastwise beneath it all.\n‘Oh, that old northern business …’ A field\nAfter battle utters its own sound\nWhich is like nothing on earth, but is earth.\nBlindly the questing snail, vulnerable\nMole emerge, blindly we lie down, blindly\nAmong carnage the most delicate souls\nTup in their marriage-blood, gasping ‘Jesus’.\n\n\n4\n\nLet mind be more precious than soul; it will not\nEndure. Soul grasps its price, begs its own peace,\nSettles with tears and sweat, is possibly\nIndestructible. That I can believe.\nThough I would scorn the mere instinct of faith,\nExpediency of assent, if I dared,\nWhat I dare not is a waste history\nOr void rule. Averroes, old heathen,\nIf only you had been right, if Intellect\nItself were absolute law, sufficient grace,\nOur lives could be a myth of captivity\nWhich we might enter: an unpeopled region\nOf ever new-fallen snow, a palace blazing\nWith perpetual silence as with torches.\n\n\n5\n\nAs with torches we go, at wild Christmas,\nWhen we revel in our atonement\nThrough thirty feasts of unction and slaughter,\nWhat is that but the soul’s winter sleep?\nSo many things rest under consummate\nJustice as though trumpets purified law,\nSpikenard were the real essence of remorse.\nThe sky gathers up darkness. When we chant\n‘Ora, ora pro nobis’ it is not\nSeraphs who descend to pity but ourselves.\nThose righteously-accused those vengeful\nRacked on articulate looms indulge us\nWith lingering shows of pain, a flagrant\nTenderness of the damned for their own flesh:\n\n\n6\n\nMy little son, when you could command marvels\nWithout mercy, outstare the wearisome\nDragon of sleep, I rejoiced above all—\nA stranger well-received in your kingdom.\nOn those pristine fields I saw humankind\nAs it was named by the Father; fabulous\nBeasts rearing in stillness to be blessed.\nThe world’s real cries reached there, turbulence\nFrom remote storms, rumour of solitudes,\nA composed mystery. And so it ends.\nSome parch for what they were; others are made\nBlind to all but one vision, their necessity\nTo be reconciled. I believe in my\nAbandonment, since it is what I have.\n\n\n7\n\n‘Prowess, vanity, mutual regard,\nIt seemed I stared at them, they at me.\nThat was the gorgon’s true and mortal gaze:\nAverted conscience turned against itself.’\nA hawk and a hawk-shadow. ‘At noon,\nAs the armies met, each mirrored the other;\nNeither was outshone. So they flashed and vanished\nAnd all that survived them was the stark ground\nOf this pain. I made no sound, but once\nI stiffened as though a remote cry\nHad heralded my name. It was nothing …’\nReddish ice tinged the reeds; dislodged, a few\nFeathers drifted across; carrion birds\nStrutted upon the armour of the dead.\n\n\n8\n\nNot as we are but as we must appear,\nContractual ghosts of pity; not as we\nDesire life but as they would have us live,\nSet apart in timeless colloquy.\nSo it is required; so we bear witness,\nDespite ourselves, to what is beyond us,\nEach distant sphere of harmony forever\nPoised, unanswerable. If it is without\nConsequence when we vaunt and suffer, or\nIf it is not, all echoes are the same\nIn such eternity. Then tell me, love,\nHow that should comfort us—or anyone\nDragged half-unnerved out of this worldly place,\nCrying to the end ‘I have not finished’.",

And yet\nWhen your eyes meet my eyes, they'll bring into\nThe weightlessness of my pure wish the weight\nOf a human being: someone to help or hurt,\nSomeone to be good to me, to be good to,\nSomeone to cry when I am angry\nthat she doesn't like Elektra, someone to start on Proust with.\nA wish, come true, is life. I have my life.\nWhen you turn just slide your eyes across my eyes\nAnd show in a look flickering across your face\nAs lightly as a leaf's shade, a bird's wing,\nThat there is no one in the world quite like me,\nThat if only...If only...\nThat will be enough.\n\nBut I've pretended long enough: I walk faster\nAnd come close, touch with the tip of my finger\nThe nape of her neck, just where the gold\nHair stops, and the champagne-colored dress begins.\nMy finger touches her as the gingko's shadow\nTouches her.\nBecause, after all, it is my wife\nIn a new dress from Bergdorf's, walking toward the park.\nShe cries out, we kiss each other, and walk arm in arm\nThrough the sunlight that's much too good for New York,\nThe sunlight of our own house in the forest.\nStill, though, the poor things need it...We've no need\nTo start out on Proust, to ask each other about Strauss.\nWe first helped each other, hurt each other, years ago.\nAfter so many changes made and joys repeated,\nOur first bewildered, transcending recognition\nIs pure acceptance.   We can't tell our life\nFrom our wish. Really I began the day\nNot with a man's wish: \"May this day be different,\"\nBut with the birds' wish: \"May this day\nBe the same day, the day of my life.\"",

At the top of the dune, the thorny\ncrowns of buried trees, their teeter-totter\nbranches a candelabra for the spiders’\nsilvery halo of threads.

    "text": "Is this what I was made for? Is the world that fits\nLike what I feel when I wake up each morning? Steamclouds\nHovering over the lake, and smoke ascending from ten thousand chimneys\nAs in a picture on a calendar, in a frieze of ordinary days?\nBeneath a sky of oatmeal gray, the land slides downwards from a Kmart parking lot\nInto a distance lined with bungalows, and then a vague horizon.\nHigher and higher, until its gaze becomes a part of what it sees,\nThe mind ascends through layers of immobility into an unfamiliar atmosphere\nWhere nothing lives, and with a sense of finally breaking free\nAttains its kingdom: a constructed space, or an imaginary city\nBordered all around by darkness; or a city gradually sinking into age,\nDominated by a television tower whose blue light warns the traveler away.\n\nPeople change, or drift away, or die. It used to be a country\nBounded by possibility, from which the restless could embark\nAnd then come home to, and where the soul could find an emblem of itself.\nSome days I feel a momentary lightness, but then the density returns,\nThe salt-encrusted cars drive by the factory where a clock tower\nOverlooks the highway, and the third shift ends. And then softly,\nThe way the future used to sing to me when I was ten years old,\nI start to hear the murmur of a voice that isn’t mine at all,\nFormless and indistinct, the music of a world that holds no place for me;\nAnd then an image starts to gather in my mind—a picture of a room\nWhere someone lingers at a window, staring at a nearly empty street\nBordered by freight yards and abandoned tanneries. And then the bus stops\nAnd a man gets off, and stands still, and then walks away.\n\nLast night I had a dream in which the image of a long-forgotten love\nHovered over the city. No one could remember what his name was\nOr where he came from, or decipher what that emptiness might mean;\nYet on the corner, next to the USA Today machine, a woman seemed to wave at me,\nUntil the stream of morning traffic blocked her from my view.\nIt’s strange, the way a person’s life can feel so far away,\nAlthough the claims of its existence are encountered everywhere\n—In a drugstore, or on the cover of a tabloid, on the local news\nOr in the mail that came this morning, in the musings of some talk show host\nWhose face is an enigma and whose name is just a number in the phone book,\nBut whose words are as pervasive as the atmosphere I breathe.\nWhy can’t I find my name in this profusion? Nothing even stays,\nNo image glances back at me, no inner angel hurls itself in rage\nAgainst the confines of this surface that confronts me everywhere I look\n—At home or far away, here or on the way back from the store—\nBehind an all-inclusive voice and personality, fashioned out of fear\nAnd scattered like a million isolated points transmitting random images\nAcross a space alive with unconnected signals.\n\nI heard my name\nOnce, but then the noise of waiting patiently resumed. It felt the same,\nYet gradually the terms I used to measure out my life increased,\nUntil I realized that I’d been driving down these streets for sixteen years.\nI was part of the surroundings: people looked at me the way I used to look at them,\nAnd most of what I felt seemed second nature. Now and then that sense I’d had in high school\n—Of a puzzlement about to lift, a language just about to start—\nMeandered into consciousness; but by and large I’d spend the days\nLike something in the background, or like part of a design too intricate to see.\nWasn’t there supposed to be a stage at which the soul at last broke free\nAnd started to meet the world on equal terms? To feel a little more at home,\nMore intensely realized, more successfully contained\nWithin the arc of its achievements? Filled with reservations,\nMoods and private doubts, yet always moving, with increasing confidence,\nTowards a kind of summary, towards the apex of a long career\nAdvancing down an avenue that opened on a space of sympathy and public understanding?\nOr howling like the wind in the wires outside my window, in a cacophony of rage?\nI don’t think so. Age is like the dreams one had in childhood,\nSome parts of which were true—I have the things I want, the words to misdescribe them,\nAnd the freedom to imagine what I think I feel. I think that most of what I feel remains unknown,\nBut that beneath my life lies something intricate and real and\nNearly close enough to touch. I live it, and I know I should explain it,\nOnly I know I can’t—it’s just an image of my life that came to me one day,\nAnd which remained long after the delight it brought had ended.\nSometimes I think I hear the sound of death approaching\nLike a song in the trees, a performance staged for me and me alone\nAnd written in the ersatz language of loss, the language of time passing,\nOr the sound of someone speaking decorously into the unknown\n—Like a voice picked up on the telephone when two lines cross momentarily\n—Overheard, and then half heard, and then gone.",

Athwart the mists,\nFar into vacant space, huge shadows stretch\nAnd seem realities; while things of life,\nObvious to sight and touch, all glowing round,\nFade to the hue of shadows. Scruples here,\nWith filmy net, most like the autumnal webs\nOf floating gossamer, arrest the foot\nOf generous enterprise; and palsy hope\nAnd fair ambition with the chilling touch\nOf sickly hesitation and blank fear.\nNor seldom Indolence these lawns among\nFixes her turf-built seat; and wears the garb\nOf deep philosophy, and museful sits\nIn dreamy twilight of the vacant mind,\nSoothed by the whispering shade; for soothing soft\nThe shades; and vistas lengthening into air,\nWith moonbeam rainbows tinted. Here each mind\nOf finer mould, acute and delicate,\nIn its high progress to eternal truth\nRests for a space, in fairy bowers entranced;\nAnd loves the softened light and tender gloom;\nAnd, pampered with most unsubstantial food,\nLooks down indignant on the grosser world,\nAnd matter’s cumbrous shapings. Youth beloved\nOf science — of the Muse beloved, — not here,\nNot in the maze of metaphysic lore,\nBuild thou thy place of resting! Lightly tread\nThe dangerous ground, on noble aims intent;\nAnd be this Circe of the studious cell\nEnjoyed, but still subservient. Active scenes\nShall soon with healthful spirit brace thy mind;\nAnd fair exertion, for bright fame sustained,\nFor friends, for country, chase each spleen-fed fog\nThat blots the wide creation —\nNow heaven conduct thee with a parent’s love!",

In half-light\nthe empty house is less familiar, less sad—the walls\nwith their nail holes, the carpet—its patterns of wear,\ncurtains with no job to do. I sit\non my suitcase, eat powdered donuts;\na napkin for a plate, juice out of a paper cup.\nMake one last check of the cupboards,\nthe drawers.

I counted\nthe number of intersections on the way to school (four).\nI bundle memories together, weight them with stones\nlike unwanted kittens drowned in a creek.\n\nWhat kind of animal constantly moves?\nThe point of migration is the return.\nWe're nomads without the base knowledge\nof where to find water. These moves are\nlike arranged marriages; economics now,\nlove later. Maybe it's not against nature\nto move. Most of the body is no more\nthan ten years old and blood renews itself\nevery 90 days. But leaving disturbs the fabric\nof a place. I'd rather stay and witness change.\nMy mother always wanting to plant perennials\nthat we never stay to see. I pour some water\non the marigolds clattering around the mailbox,\nAztec flowers of death, their strong scent\na beacon to lost souls. Then we drive away,\nthe blank windows like the blank eyes of\nthe dead, waiting for someone to seal the past with a penny.",

Where's the face\nOne would meet in every place?\nWhere's the voice, however soft,\nOne would hear so very oft?\nAt a touch sweet Pleasure melteth\nLike to bubbles when rain pelteth.\nLet, then, winged Fancy find\nThee a mistress to thy mind:\nDulcet-ey'd as Ceres' daughter,\nEre the God of Torment taught her\nHow to frown and how to chide;\nWith a waist and with a side\nWhite as Hebe's, when her zone\nSlipt its golden clasp, and down\nFell her kirtle to her feet,\nWhile she held the goblet sweet\nAnd Jove grew languid.—Break the mesh\nOf the Fancy's silken leash;\nQuickly break her prison-string\nAnd such joys as these she'll bring.—\nLet the winged Fancy roam,\nPleasure never is at home.",

They watched them stand in the field and chew. “Which one,” asked Walter B., “do you think is the hero?” “That one,” said Beatrice. “Definitely that one. The one with the mittens.” “Yes,” agreed Walter B., “the others seem less... festooned.” “And which one do you think,” asked Walter B., “is the traitor?” Beatrice bit her lip and looked around. “Maybe that one,” she said. “The one with the orange flower in the pocket of his vest.” Walter B. agreed, but to be certain he thought that he should ask. “Little traitor,” called out Walter B. The traitor looked up. “I knew it!” said Beatrice, clapping her hands. The traitor came closer. The wind shook the orange flower loose from his pocket, but he did not run after it. He missed his mother. The traitor came closer, but then he stopped. He curled into his flowerless vest and fell asleep. Walter B. and Beatrice yawned. The soldiers dressed like children opened their mouths as wide as they could, but there was no more candy. There would never again be more candy. And so they sailed away to another land.",

She takes a stack of dinner plates from my cupboard and slinks off to the park to break them. Our brother shows up a week later, collapses on the sofa like a fur throw. Why have they come here when everything I do is wrong? They howl in the shower together but the water doesn’t mask the sound. I go in afterwards with paper towels to mop the droplets–I know there’ll be water all over–but the room is bone dry. Maybe this time things will be different. I hide the home movies in case they ask for them. In the one I always watch, there’s some wobbly footage of the sky, then my father lowers the camera’s eye to mother teaching my sister and brother to “tell time.” They’re following a mother hare on her sunset rounds–one leveret mouthful at 12 o’clock, another at 3, 6, 9. Then the camera zooms in on me–I’ve spat out my pacifier made of fur and I’m on the porch surrounded by bonsai trees, killing or saving Barbie.",

    "text": "Foreword to “Dancing on the Grave of a Son of a Bitch”\n\nThis poem is more properly a “dance poem” than a song or chant because the element of repetition is created by\nmovements\nof language rather than duplicating words and sounds. However, it is in the spirit of ritual recitation that I wrote it/ a performance to drive away bad spirits perhaps.\n\nThe story behind the poem is this: a man and woman who have been living together for some time separate. Part of the pain of separation involves possessions which they had shared. They both angrily believe they should have what they want. She asks for some possession and he denies her the right to it. She replies that she gave him money for a possession which he has and therefore should have what she wants now. He replies that she has forgotten that for the number of years they lived together he never charged her rent and if he had she would now owe him $7,000.\n\nShe is appalled that he equates their history with a sum of money. She is even more furious to realize that this sum of money represents the entire rent on the apartment and implies that he should not have paid anything at all. She is furious. She kills him mentally. Once and for all she decides she is well rid of this man and that she shouldn’t feel sad at their parting. She decides to prove to herself that she’s glad he’s gone from her life. With joy she will dance on all the bad memories of their life together.\n\nfor my motorcycle betrayer\nGod damn it,\nat last I am going to dance on your grave,\nold man;\nyou’ve stepped on my shadow once too often,\nyou’ve been unfaithful to me with other women,\nwomen so cheap and insipid it psychs me out to think I might\never\nbe put\nin the same category with them;\nyou’ve left me alone so often that I might as well have been\na homesteader in Alaska\nthese past years;\nand you’ve left me, thrown me out of your life\noften enough\nthat I might as well be a newspaper,\ndifferently discarded each day.\nNow you’re gone for good\nand I don’t know why\nbut your leaving actually made me as miserable\nas an earthworm with no\nearth,\nbut now I’ve crawled out of the ground where you stomped me\nand I gradually stand taller and taller each\nday.\nI have learned to sing new songs,\nand as I sing,\nI’m going to dance on your grave\nbecause you are\ndead\ndead\ndead\nunder the earth with the rest of the shit,\nI’m going to plant deadly nightshade\non your grassy mound\nand make sure a hemlock tree starts growing there.\nHenbane is too good for you,\nbut I’ll let a bit grow there for good measure\nbecause we want to dance,\nwe want to sing,\nwe want to throw this old man\nto the wolves,\nbut they are too beautiful for him, singing in harmony\nwith each other.\nSo some white wolves and I\nwill sing on your grave, old man\nand dance for the joy of your death.\n“Is this an angry statement?”\n“No, it is a statement of joy.”\n“Will the sun shine again?”\n\"Yes,\nyes,\nyes,”\nbecause I’m going to dance dance dance\nDuncan’s measure, and Pindar’s tune,\nLorca’s cadence, and Creeley’s hum,\nStevens’ sirens and Williams’ little Morris dance,\noh, the poets will call the tune,\nand I will dance, dance, dance\non your grave, grave, grave,\nbecause you’re a sonofabitch, a sonofabitch,\nand you tried to do me in,\nbut you cant cant cant.\nYou were a liar in a way that only I know:\nYou ride a broken motorcycle,\nYou speak a dead language\nYou are a bad plumber,\nAnd you write with an inkless pen.\nYou were mean to me,\nand I’ve survived,\nGod damn you,\nat last I am going to dance on your grave,\nold man,\nI’m going to learn every traditional dance,\nevery measure,\nand dance dance dance on your grave\none step\nfor every time\nyou done me wrong.",

    "text": "When I learned I could own a piece of The World\nI got my chequebook out. Eternal life belongs to those\nwho live in the present. My wife's bright eye affirmed it.\nAs do the soothing neutral tones and classic-contemporary\ndecor of our professionally designed apartments,\nprivate verandahs before which the globe, endlessly\nand effortlessly circumnavigated, slips by, allowing residents\nno end of exotic ports, a new destination every few days\nto explore with a depth we hadn't thought possible.\nIt's not how things are on The World that is mystical,\nnot the market and deli, proximity of masseuse\nand sommelier, not the gym, our favourite restaurant,\nour other favourite restaurant, the yacht club, the library,\nthe golf pro, the pool, but that it exists at all, a limited\nwhole, a logic and a feeling. What looks like freedom\nis, in fact, the perfection of a plan, and property\na stocktaking laid against us in a measure. The difference\nbetween a thing thought, and done. One can ignore neither\nthe practical applications nor the philosophical significance\nof our onboard jewelry emporium, its $12 million inventory,\nnatural yellow diamonds from South Africa no one needs,\nthus satisfying the criteria for beauty. Without which\nthere is no life of the mind. What we share, though, transcends\nownership, our self-improvement guaranteed\nby the itineraries, licensed experts who prepare us\nfor each new harbour and beyond, deliver us into the hands\nof native companions on The World's perpetual course.\nThe visual field has no limits. And the eye—\nthe eye devours. Polar bears, musk oxen, rare thick-billed\nmurre. We golfed on the tundra and from The World\nwere airlifted to pristine snowfields, clifftops where we dined\nalfresco above frozen seas. The World is the entirety.\nThe largest ship ever to traverse the Northwest Passage.\nHow the silent energy coursed between us. Fundamental rules\nhad changed. Except, with time, it seems a sort of accident—\nnatural objects combined in states of affairs, their internal properties. Accusatory randomness and proliferation\nof types, brutal quantity literally brought to our doors.\nOr past them, as if on the OLED high-def screen\nof our circumstances, which hides more than it reveals.\nFor what we see could be other than it is.\nWhatever we're able to describe at all could be other\nthan it is. Such assaults on our finer feelings require an appeal\nto order, to the exercise of discipline a private Jacuzzi represents,\nfrom which one might peacefully enjoy the singular euphoria\nof the Panama Canal or long-awaited departure\nfrom fetid Venice. There is some truth in solipsism, but I fear\nI'm doing it wrong, standing at the rail for ceremonial cast-offs\nthunderously accessorized with Vangelis or \"Non, je ne regrette rien,\"\nmade irritable by appreciative comments about the light.\nIn Reykjavík or Cape Town, it's the same. Familiarity\nwithout intimacy is the cost of privacy, security\nof a thread count so extravagant its extent can no longer\nbe detected. Even at capacity, The World is eerily empty:\nits crew of highly trained specialists in housekeeping,\nmaintenance, beauty, and cuisine—the heart and soul\nof the endeavour—are largely unseen and likely where the fun is.\nWe sit at the captain's table but don't know him. He's Italian.\nI think on my Clarksville boyhood long before EPS, ROE—\nretractable clothesline sunk in concrete, modest backyard\na staging ground for potential we felt infinite to the degree\nour parents knew it wasn't. The unknown is where we played.\nAnd while fulfilment of a premeditated outcome\nconfers a nearly spiritual comfort of indifference\nto the time of year, a paradise of fruits always in season,\nthe span of choice defines its limit, which cannot be exceeded.\nThe sea rolls over, props on an elbow, and now is heard\nthe small sound of a daydream running softly aground.\nDissatisfaction, in a Danish sense. On prevailing winds a scent\nof compromise; for one tires of the spacewalk outside\nwhat is the case. Beyond immediate luxuries\nlives speculation and the tragic impression one is yet\nto be born. It could be when all pursuits have been satisfied,\nlife's problems will remain untouched. But doubt exists only\nwhere questions exist. The World satisfies its own conditions.\nIt argues for itself. Herein lies an answer.",

    "text": "Who is your lady of love, O ye that pass\nSinging? and is it for sorrow of that which was\nThat ye sing sadly, or dream of what shall be?\nFor gladly at once and sadly it seems ye sing.\n— Our lady of love by you is unbeholden;\nFor hands she hath none, nor eyes, nor lips, nor golden\nTreasure of hair, nor face nor form; but we\nThat love, we know her more fair than anything.\n\n— Is she a queen, having great gifts to give?\n— Yea, these; that whoso hath seen her shall not live\nExcept he serve her sorrowing, with strange pain,\nTravail and bloodshedding and bitterer tears;\nAnd when she bids die he shall surely die.\nAnd he shall leave all things under the sky\nAnd go forth naked under sun and rain\nAnd work and wait and watch out all his years.\n\n— Hath she on earth no place of habitation?\n— Age to age calling, nation answering nation,\nCries out, Where is she? and there is none to say;\nFor if she be not in the spirit of men,\nFor if in the inward soul she hath no place,\nIn vain they cry unto her, seeking her face,\nIn vain their mouths make much of her; for they\nCry with vain tongues, till the heart lives again.\n\n— O ye that follow, and have ye no repentance?\nFor on your brows is written a mortal sentence,\nAn hieroglyph of sorrow, a fiery sign,\nThat in your lives ye shall not pause or rest,\nNor have the sure sweet common love, nor keep\nFriends and safe days, nor joy of life nor sleep.\n— These have we not, who have one thing, the divine\nFace and clear eyes of faith and fruitful breast.\n\n— And ye shall die before your thrones be won.\n— Yea, and the changed world and the liberal sun\nShall move and shine without us, and we lie\nDead; but if she too move on earth and live,\nBut if the old world with all the old irons rent\nLaugh and give thanks, shall we be not content?\nNay, we shall rather live, we shall not die,\nLife being so little and death so good to give.\n\n— And these men shall forget you.—Yea, but we\nShall be a part of the earth and the ancient sea,\nAnd heaven-high air august, and awful fire,\nAnd all things good; and no man's heart shall beat\nBut somewhat in it of our blood once shed\nShall quiver and quicken, as now in us the dead\nBlood of men slain and the old same life's desire\nPlants in their fiery footprints our fresh feet.\n\n— But ye that might be clothed with all things pleasant,\nYe are foolish that put off the fair soft present,\nThat clothe yourselves with the cold future air;\nWhen mother and father and tender sister and brother\nAnd the old live love that was shall be as ye,\nDust, and no fruit of loving life shall be.\n— She shall be yet who is more than all these were,\nThan sister or wife or father unto us or mother.\n\n— Is this worth life, is this, to win for wages?\nLo, the dead mouths of the awful grey-grown ages,\nThe venerable, in the past that is their prison,\nIn the outer darkness, in the unopening grave,\nLaugh, knowing how many as ye now say have said,\nHow many, and all are fallen, are fallen and dead:\nShall ye dead rise, and these dead have not risen?\n—Not we but she, who is tender and swift to save.\n\n— Are ye not weary and faint not by the way,\nSeeing night by night devoured of day by day,\nSeeing hour by hour consumed in sleepless fire?\nSleepless: and ye too, when shall ye too sleep?\n— We are weary in heart and head, in hands and feet,\nAnd surely more than all things sleep were sweet,\nThan all things save the inexorable desire\nWhich whoso knoweth shall neither faint nor weep.\n\n— Is this so sweet that one were fain to follow?\nIs this so sure where all men's hopes are hollow.\nEven this your dream, that by much tribulation\nYe shall make whole flawed hearts, and bowed necks straight?\n— Nay, though our life were blind, our death were fruitless,\nNot therefore were the whole world's high hope rootless;\nBut man to man, nation would turn to nation,\nAnd the old life live, and the old great world be great.\n\n— Pass on then and pass by us and let us be,\nFor what light think ye after life to see?\nAnd if the world fare better will ye know?\nAnd if man triumph who shall seek you and say?\n— Enough of light is this for one life's span,\nThat all men born are mortal, but not man:\nAnd we men bring death lives by night to sow,\nThat man may reap and eat and live by day.",

To wake once from the sleep in which\nyou are held, in which your name emanates without utterance\nfrom the being that cradles you—There is no other sleep.\n\nNow it is always afternoon. How can I call you\nwhen we have no names? I search\nfor the clover and violets. There are always enough.\nMy shadow is always the same length and shaped\n\nwith arms and legs.

Nevertheless, whoever you are it is not up to you to give up your hope. And additionally you are spoiling the day.” “What is ‘giving up your hope’?” asked Beatrice. “It is when,” explained Walter B., “you have to ask.”\n\n*\n\nIt all began with the appearance of The Unlikelies. It was difficult to anticipate in these small men sitting cross-legged on the living room floor the havoc they would bring. They held hands. They sang a song about trees, and as they sang their tree-shaped ears swelled with what Beatrice would later describe as pride. They asked for gently steamed vegetables. They seemed genuinely concerned. “Pick a heart,” they cheered, “any heart.” Beatrice picked one. “Expect for that one.” Beatrice picked another. “And that one, too.” “That was less joyous,” said Beatrice, “than I’d expected.” “The hearts you picked,” explained The Unlikelies, “had been picked yesterday.” “It is unlikely,” said The Unlikelies, “that will happen again.” Walter B. hid in the kitchen. Whose side The Unlikelies were on, Beatrice began to wonder. “Pick a heart,” they urged. Beatrice picked another. “Except for that one.” Beatrice picked another. “And that one, too.” With each heart Beatrice picked The Unlikelies grew larger. They seemed genuinely concerned. “All is dare,” they reminded Beatrice with their mouths full of broccoli, and carrots, and peas, “in blur and core.” By dawn, Walter B. could still hear Beatrice picking hearts. Their empty husks filled the floor. The Unlikelies huddled closer together. “Except for that one,” they mumbled sleepily, moving closer to the door. The Unlikelies were, by now, as big as the furniture. “And that one, too.” Walter B. hid in the kitchen. He imagined he would make out of all the husks a hearty soup. He rummaged for a pot. He would feed Beatrice the soup, drop by drop, until she forgot this highly unlikely event impossible to forsee by any hopeful thing. “All is spare in buds and more,” promised The Unlikelies, as they squeezed their enormous bodies out the door.\n\n*\n\nDays later, when Beatrice asked Walter B. if The Unlikelies were still standing outside in the sunlight, congratulating each other, Walter B. said “no.” But Beatrice knew they were there.

    "text": "I  Self-Portrait\n\nA house\nwith three stories.\nIn the basement, monsters.\nThe upper floors were empty.\nNo furniture, nothing.\nI had a magic pebble\nthat I needed to hide.\nBut where?\nWoke in a room\nwith the bed breathing.\nEach day the same\nscandal—this body.\nThese teeth and hands.\n\n\n\n\n\n2  The Miniature Bed\n\nA miniature bed, and in it two tiny people\nnot sleeping, not able to sleep because\na small lie has flowered between them,\nfragile as a new, white crocus.\nThe miniature bed holds them like a miniature boat\nmaking its slow, true course to morning.\nThese tiny people, thoughts thrumming like mice,\nare quiet as the lie blooms over them\nin the night, fanning its moth petals,\nbecoming to them like a moon hovering\nover their bed, a moon they might almost touch\nwith their miniature hands, if they weren't certain\nthat one wrong gesture might break\nthe spindles of their small world, if their hearts\nwere not drops of trembling quicksilver,\nif they were brave, if they could see\nthat small is no smaller than big, that thimbles\nare deep as oceans for any god, they might even\ntouch each other then, opening the dark,\nlike a match, the sun's flaring.\n\n3  Harvest\n\nThe fields are a book of uses.\nNear the house\na combine takes the corn down\nin long rows.\nDust rises up and replaces itself.\nA quick net of starlings\ndrops to the furrows\nand sunshine pours like polished grain\nonto the feeding earth,\nthis country.\n\nIn the kitchen, milk streams\nfrom the gallon\nthin and fresh as luck.\nWe flourish.\nAll around us, things flourish.\nCows strain the fence with their abundance.\nThe herd makes a sound like swelling.\n\nOut in the cut field\nbirds clean the fallen cobs\ninto sets of teeth.\n\n4  Sonnet for Lost Teeth\n\nThe combines were tearing off the field’s clothes.\nIt was August, haying season. My tooth\nwas loose, a snag in the clam of my mouth.\nI worked it like a pearl. I'd been out of school\nfor sixty days. In the sweat of the barn\nI watched him shoot the calf in the head.\nHe wiped the hide gently, like cleaning his glasses.\nOvernight, I grew a beard so I wouldn't\nhave to get married. I let my feet go black\nfrom burned grasses.It never gets easier\nhe said, kicking straw over the blood patch.\nShe went down so quiet it was almost\nsad. Later, when my tooth fell out, I buried it\nunder my pillow and it grew into money.\n\n5  Talisman\n\nWaiting for the school bus you find\nthe femur of a baby animal\non the ground. You carry\nthat femur in your pocket\nthe entire morning and touch it\nsecretly through the cloth.\nWhen the teacher asks\na question you don't raise\nyour hand but quietly\nwrap your fingers around\nthe thin shape, that bone\nwithout a mother.\n\n6  On Waking\n\nHalf of everything is invisible.\nA river drifts below the river.\nA gesture lost in the body.\nWind moves through the open\nwindows of the trees.\n\nBeyond the day, another day.\n\nDreamed I was drowning\nmy mother's silk laundry\nin the river,\nkneeling on the wet rocks.\nBack and forth I drowned it\nin the gray clouds...\n\n7  Eros\n\nEach year fish run the green vein of the river.\nThe bones of skunks lie buried in the riverbank\nupside down, waiting for rain.\n\nFrom a fragment of a Greek statue\nyou can tell the posture of the whole god.\nA skeleton has the same intelligence.\n\nSo that when a girl discovers it,\nloosened by summer rain, surfaced\nlike a white instrument in the grass,\nshe suddenly knows how to take it up\nand shake the strange rhythms from it like castanets.\n\n8  A Childhood\n\nThe horse had been beaten and flies\ncrawled excited on the beat marks.\nHe held still in the sunblazed pasture.\nFor a few minutes I stood at the wire fence.\nHe was aware of me, but he did not turn—\nexcept his eye, slightly. He listened\nthrough the many ears of the grasses.\nA jay made a hole in the air with its cry.\nEverywhere, invisible as heat, the gods\nmarried each other and went to war.\nThe excitement of it vibrated in the flies.\nAs if we both were standing still\ninside some greater, more violent motion.",

The strange tale\n(Not until Rhaicos died, but then the whole)\nEchion had related, whom no force\nCould ever make look back upon the oaks.\nThe father said “Echion! thou must weigh,\nCarefully, and with steady hand, enough\n(Although no longer comes the store as once!)\nOf wax to burn all day and night upon\nThat hollow stone where milk and honey lie:\nSo may the Gods, so may the dead, be pleas’d!”\nThallinos bore it thither in the morn,\nAnd lighted it and left it.\n\nFirst of those\nWho visited upon this solemn day\nThe Hamadryad’s oak, were Rhodope\nAnd Acon; of one age, one hope, one trust.\nGraceful was she as was the nymph whose fate\nShe sorrowed for: he slender, pale, and first\n\nLapt by the flame of love: his father’s lands\nWere fertile, herds lowed over them afar.\nNow stood the two aside the hollow stone\nAnd lookt with stedfast eyes toward the oak\nShivered and black and bare.\n\n“May never we\nLove as they loved!” said Acon. She at this\nSmiled, for he said not what he meant to say,\nAnd thought not of its bliss, but of its end.\nHe caught the flying smile, and blusht, and vow’d\nNor time nor other power, whereto the might\nOf love hath yielded and may yield again,\nShould alter his.\n\nThe father of the youth\nWanted not beauty for him, wanted not\nSong, that could lift earth’s weight from off his heart,\nDiscretion, that could guide him thro’ the world,\nInnocence, that could clear his way to heaven;\nSilver and gold and land, not green before\nThe ancestral gate, but purple under skies\nBending far off, he wanted for his heir.\n\nFathers have given life, but virgin heart\nThey never gave; and dare they then control\nOr check it harshly? dare they break a bond\nGirt round it by the holiest Power on high?\n\nAcon was grieved, he said, grieved bitterly,\nBut Acon had complied . . ’twas dutiful!\n\nCrush thy own heart, Man! Man! but fear to wound\nThe gentler, that relies on thee alone,\nBy thee created, weak or strong by thee;\nTouch it not but for worship; watch before\nIts sanctuary; nor leave it till are closed\nThe temple-doors and the last lamp is spent.\n\nRhodope, in her soul’s waste solitude,\nSate mournful by the dull-resounding sea,\nOften not hearing it, and many tears\nHad the cold breezes hardened on her cheek.\nMeanwhile he sauntered in the wood of oaks,\nNor shun’d to look upon the hollow stone\nThat held the milk and honey, nor to lay\nHis plighted hand where recently ’twas laid\nOpposite hers, when finger playfully\nAdvanced and pusht back finger, on each side.\nHe did not think of this, as she would do\nIf she were there alone.\n\nThe day was hot;\nThe moss invited him; it cool’d his cheek,\nIt cool’d his hands; he thrust them into it\nAnd sank to slumber. Never was there dream\nDivine as his. He saw the Hamadryad.\nShe took him by the arm and led him on\nAlong a valley, where profusely grew\nThe smaller lilies with their pendent bells,\nAnd, hiding under mint, chill drosera,\nThe violet shy of butting cyclamen,\nThe feathery fern, and, browser of moist banks,\nHer offspring round her, the soft strawberry;\nThe quivering spray of ruddy tamarisk,\nThe oleander’s light-hair’d progeny\nBreathing bright freshness in each other’s face,\nAnd graceful rose, bending her brow, with cup\n\nOf fragrance and of beauty, boon for Gods.\nThe fragrance fill’d his breast with such delight\nHis senses were bewildered, and he thought\nHe saw again the face he most had loved.\nHe stopt: the Hamadryad at his side\nNow stood between; then drew him farther off:\nHe went, compliant as before: but soon\nVerdure had ceast: altho’ the ground was smooth,\nNothing was there delightful. At this change\nHe would have spoken, but his guide represt\nAll questioning, and said,\n\n“Weak youth! what brought\nThy footstep to this wood, my native haunt,\nMy life-long residence? this bank, where first\nI sate with him . . the faithful (now I know,\nToo late!) the faithful Rhaicos. Haste thee home;\nBe happy, if thou canst; but come no more\nWhere those whom death alone could sever, died.”\n\nHe started up: the moss whereon he slept\nWas dried and withered: deadlier paleness spread\nOver his cheek; he sickened: and the sire\nHad land enough; it held his only son.",

Seventeen dead carried down hallways they walked, past cases of trophies they won, flyers for clubs they belonged to, lockers they won’t open again. Seventeen Valentine’s Day dates broken and cards unopened. Seventeen bodies to identify, dozens of photo albums to page through and remember their lives. Seventeen caskets and burial garments to choose for them. Seventeen funerals to attend in twelve days. Seventeen graves dug and headstones placed—all marked with the same date of death. Seventeen names: Alyssa. Helena. Scott. Martin—seventeen absentees forever—Nicholas. Aaron. Jamie. Luke—seventeen closets to clear out—Christopher. Cara. Gina. Joaquin—seventeen empty beds—Alaina. Meadow. Alex. Carmen. Peter—seventeen reasons to rebel with the hope these will be the last seventeen to be taken by one of three-hundred-ninety-three-million guns in America.",

We were piloted by Auden who became\nUnbearably acrimonious when we dropped off Senghor into the\nsteamy skies of his beloved West Africa. The termites and ants\nwere waiting for him to unearth the sun in Elissa. The clouds\nwere as cool as a dog’s nose pressed against our cheeks. I\nnotice your eggshell skin is as creamy as a lion’s armpit as we\ncross the horizon on strands of Yeats’ silver hair. There is a\nlight coffee flame in his eyes guiding us like an old Irish house\ncleaner holding a candle in a black and white English movie.\nYeats’ lips look like an angry Rimbaud illuminating poetry with\nhis youth and vigorous sunlight. He knew eternity would vanish\nthe sun at dusk. He caught it with a rainbow tied to his finger.\nThere was nothing left after that. We cross the equator\nheading north following Emily Dickinson’s black bag containing\nstems of her longer poems preserved in darkness and memory\nlike wild pearls thrown overboard to avoid capture by Spanish\npirates. The islands below float by like water hearts in a child’s\naquarium. We are candy wrappers being blown across the\nwaxed floors of poetry. We land on the Brooklyn Bridge.\nWhitman’s past-port face is grinning at the nineteenth century\nin the thorny arms of Gerard Manley Hopkins whose head was\nset on fire by God’s little hands. The hands that circumcised\nthe world. Gertrude Stein is a match flaring on a young\nwoman’s pillow whose birthmarks have been stolen. We cross\nthe green Atlantic into World War One. We are met by Rilke\ndressed in his Orpheus uniform wearing white sonnet gloves\nthat once belonged to a stone angel. Rilke offers us a glass of\namontillado made from Lorca’s private stock of gypsy tears.\nThe sherry is not quite as dry as Wallace Stevens’ lush mango\nmetaphors of familiar objects. Although Stevens’ poems are\nfragrant, there is a lingering afterthought of Pound on the\ntongue. Pound collected his misty feelings to make raindrops\ninto European and American poetry.

In the projects of Brooklyn, I steered myself\nto 14F, fingers spread against the cool tiles of the hallway, past the concrete\nand chicken-wire terrace where I once burnt ants with a magnifying glass.\n\nMany years later, at the Chinese restaurant uptown, Jack said:They got\nany flan here? He was my first poet. I had seen the fireflies in his sonnets\nblink and float away: Fulano the philosopher in the unemployment line;\nBlanco the painter, painting in the madhouse; Monterosa the dealer killed\nby shotgun in a bar on Avenue A; his mother the seamstress and the quick\nneedle of her sewing machine; Jack the moving man, his hands sliced raw.\nHe stacked his apartment with dictionaries in three languages. I knew\nthe raconteur’s grin with every tale:Raúl Juliá is a friend of mine:\na Puerto Rican playing Macbeth. He took14curtain calls on opening night.\n\nMaybe he would tell me now that flan was not Puerto Rican, or Mexican,\nor Spanish, but Chinese, invented by a trembling cook to satisfy the palate\nof an emperor in the Ming Dynasty.No flan, Jack, I said.This is a Chinese\nrestaurant. Two minutes later, he said:They got any flan? I showed him\nthe dog-eared and fingerprinted menu.No flan, I said. When the waiter\nunfurled his pad, Jack said to him:You got flan? He sang this song for an hour.\nThe egg roll was not flan. The fried rice was not flan. The fortune cookie\nwas not flan.Can we get some flan? he said.Goddammit, Jack, I said.\n\nThe poets crowded into the bar, striding to the mic. Jack stood with poem\nin hand, read the title, tilted his head and said it again, studied the page\nas if the words shriveled up like ants burnt under a magnifying glass,\nthen sat down. I witnessed the massacre of fireflies. A few of us clapped,\nnot knowing what to do with our hands, staring at the sonneteer who lost\nall his quatrains and couplets in the denim jacket he left on the subway,\nthe words of Fulano still waiting on the unemployment line:The faster\nyou spin, the stiller you look./There’s something to learn in that, but what?\n\nAfter the diagnosis, I handed Jack a book of poems. He dangled the book\nupside down like a stiff mouse by the tail, something we would sniff  behind\nthe refrigerator. I wanted sonnets. Jack kept singing the chorus of a song:\nGet me to the church. Get me to the church. Get me to the church on time.\n\nAt the end, I leaned over Jack’s bed to read his own poem in his ear, but some\nwords come home after the blackout, fingers crawling on the wall. I know\nwhat I should have said at the Chinese restaurant:Jack, let’s get some flan.\nWe should have braved the subway at rush hour, straphangers rocking\nall the way to 14th Street and 8th Avenue, to La Taza de Oro, gone now\nlike Jack, for rice and beans, squid in its own ink, café con leche y flan,\nJack: a spoonful of flan for you after all the years of sonnets and bread\nfor me, the steam rising when your hands cracked the crust at the table.",

That’s done indoors,\nOut of a book, which now you think of it\nIs one of the transformations of a tree.\n\nThe words themselves are a delight to learn,\nYou might be in a foreign land of terms\nLike samara, capsule, drupe, legume and pome,\nWhere bark is papery, plated, warty or smooth.\n\nBut best of all are the words that shape the leaves—\nOrbicular, cordate, cleft and reniform—\nAnd their venation—palmate and parallel—\nAnd tips—acute, truncate, auriculate.\n\nSufficiently provided, you may now\nGo forth to the forests and the shady streets\nTo see how the chaos of experience\nAnswers to catalogue and category.\n\nConfusedly. The leaves of a single tree\nMay differ among themselves more than they do\nFrom other species, so you have to find,\nAll blandly says the book, “an average leaf.”\n\nExample, the catalpa in the book\nSprays out its leaves in whorls of three\nAround the stem; the one in front of you\nBut rarely does, or somewhat, or almost;\n\nMaybe it’s not catalpa? Dreadful doubt.\nIt may be weeks before you see an elm\nFanlike in form, a spruce that pyramids,\nA sweetgum spiring up in steeple shape.\n\nStill,pedetemtim as Lucretius says,\nLittle by little, you do start to learn;\nAnd learn as well, maybe, what language does\nAnd how it does it, cutting across the world\n\nNot always at the joints, competing with\nExperience while cooperating with\nExperience, and keeping an obstinate\nIntransigence, uncanny, of its own.\n\nThink finally about the secret will\nPretending obedience to Nature, but\nInvidiously distinguishing everywhere,\nDividing up the world to conquer it,\n\nAnd think also how funny knowledge is:\nYou may succeed in learning many trees\nAnd calling off their names as you go by,\nBut their comprehensive silence stays the same.",

These notes now when it’s too late.\n2 If the cyborg you read about in bookstores is an immigrant from Mexico crossing into the U.S. beneath a floodlit court, then mine is a Punjabi-British hitchhiker on a JI visa. This is tunneling as seen from a satellite—sort of concave warp in the dirt of the line.\n3 She lives in a house with others, including animals, creating individual spaces of companionship and ardor. What happens when this domestic life grows suspect? When the grass reverts in its granular drag to the subject of architecture: the failure of a house to believe in its occupants?\n4 Mate with surfaces. Okay. Hitchhike. Okay. Make a cup of Darjeeling tea and start walking down a sidewalk in America. I saw this in a film starring George Clooney; no, Natalie Wood. The last scene is her, the gamine self, kicking off her shoes as the house explodes behind her. Perpetrating, she doesn’t flinch. Sips tea. Keeps walking. I wanted to write that. Continuance. As it related to loss. The secret pleasure of refusing to live like a normal person in a dress/with a sex drive and fingers/dreamy yet stabilized in the café of languages.\n5 I want to have sex with what I want to become. This is a statement related to women arriving in a country it would be regressive to leave. Then, writing, I was filled with a longing for—for what? George-in-the-flesh? George Clooney in Idaho, pretending to pick up hitchhikers as research for his next movie in which he plays a mild-mannered serial killer? No. A different series of acts. Tricky. For example, I’m embarrassed by this book. It makes my blood roar to think of you reading it. So intimate. A text. Then it is a document related to shame flooding the body to make it red. Who doesn’t want to heal a human body? Who doesn’t want a perfect human body? The body of my hitchhiker is, thus, inevitably female or Punjabi, fused to the production of secrets. There are no e-mails home from the e-mail café. Nothing. Phone calls, bullshitting. Sickening. I mean, what is this girl/my girl doing, there in a foreign heartland like a dog with a thumb? My Laloo, about to do it. Don’t do it, little one. Red dress. Don’t get into the car.\n6 But then, lit up, a red wife, kind of, not really, she sets out to see things as they are. Describes a virtual countryside. Jumps a box car. Drinks domestic beer. Okay. She does it and I write it down: a damaged eye with votive filaments.

Our cat Polly died\nof rabies; then all the pets had to be shot, some in the rib cage\nas they thrashed in panic. There was a pink bruise\non my forehead from pressing against the wall. We couldn't figure\n\nout how such a thing could happen. The dogs were steadfast figures\naround the farm. They chased strange cars and sometimes invoked deep\npanic among visitors and passersby. They had cuts and bruises\nfrom scuffles with roaming packs. No tags were inscribed\nwith their random Navajo names. Snazzy was skinny; his rib cage\nobvious through thin fur. He looked as if he might die\n\nfrom hunger, but he ate like nobody's business. Who knew he would die\nof rabies with the rest? The main thing was to figure\nout how they contracted it, my parents said. We cried until our rib cages\nached; our eyes stayed swollen. This first loss was too deep\nto even talk about. Decades later, I can finally describe\nhow that summer led us into a grief that felt like a bruise\n\nthat would last forever. But our neighbor suffered worse bruises:\ntheir huge dog, named Dog, was the first to die\nand was the cause of all this. Their home and fields are inscribed\nin our memories as \"the rabies place.\" Over time, they must have figured\nit was too much to live down. Childhood losses run deep,\neven though we are grandparents now. The memory is an invisible cage\n\nof anguished sobs, gunshots, yelping howls, canine rib cages\nexploding. Sometimes we reminisce and notice that the bruises\nof grief have turned pale like smoothed-over scars. That initial deep\nhurt was the start, we found, of how love could die\nright before us, even as we watched: stunned figures\npleading for mercy, urgent prayers saying, \"Let God's scribe\n\nmark this down. We've paid our dues. Our hearts are inscribed\nwith loss after loss.\" For some reason, after everything, our rib cages\nheld up and continued to cradle tender hearts. They must have figured\nthat all the prayers and careful teachings would prevent bruises\nthat would weaken us. Our love for those homely animals was deep\n\nand would figure in the knowledge that such bruises\naren't endless, and that our rib cages are not mere bones. One can die\nfrom grief, so now we can describe loss and love as the Holy Twins.",

He ran into the street.\nNever had Naples given him such a reception!\n\nThe air was darker than Vesuvius.\n“O mamma mia,”\nHe cried, “I’ve lost my voice!”\n\nAt that moment the hideous voice of Culture,\nHysterical woman, thrashing her arms and legs,\nShrieked from the ruins.\n\nAt that moment everyone became a performer.\nOtello and Don Giovanni\nAnd Figaro strode on the midmost stage.\n\nIn the high window of a burning castle\nLucia raved. Black horses\nPlunged through fire, dragging the wild bells.\n\nThe curtains were wrapped in smoke. Tin swords\nWere melting; masks and ruffs\nBurned—and the costumes of the peasants’ chorus.\n\nNight fell. The white moon rose\nAnd sank in the Pacific. The tremors\nPassed under the waves. And Death rested.\n\n\n2\nNow, as we stand idle,\nWatching the silent, bowler-hatted man,\nThe engineer, who writes in the smoking field;\n\nNow as he hands the paper to a boy,\nWho takes it and runs to a group of waiting men,\nAnd they disperse and move toward their wagons,\n\nMules bray and the wagons move—\nWait! Before you start\n(Already the wheels are rattling on the stones)\n\nSay, did your fathers cross the dry Sierras\nTo build another London?\nDo Americans always have to be second-rate?\n\nWait!

The land is within.\nAt the end of the open road we come to ourselves.\n\nThough mad Columbus follows the sun\nInto the sea, we cannot follow.\nWe must remain, to serve the returning sun,\n\nAnd to set tables for death.\nFor we are the colonists of Death—\nNot, as some think, of the English.\n\nAnd we are preparing thrones for him to sit,\nPoems to read, and beds\nIn which it may please him to rest.\n\nThis is the land\nThe pioneers looked for, shading their eyes\nAgainst the sun—a murmur of serious life.",

Emerging from the wood's\ndepths, she lights on one antenna crossbar\nthen another, her surface bright as mercury\nin a thermometer's glass. But these are fever marks\nwe are incapable of understanding. The beginning of agony?\nThe past does not enlighten us—but still, it attempts\nto say something. Perhaps the crow knows more about us\nand about history's dirt than we do ourselves.\nOf what does she want to remind us? Of the black photos, the black headphones\nof radio operators, black signatures under documents,\nof the unarmed with their frozen pupils—of the prisoner's boot or the trunk\nof the refugee? Probably not. We will remember this anyway,\nthough it won't make us any wiser. The bird signifies only stoicism\nand patience. If you ask for them, your request will be granted.",

William Ernest Henley’s “The Double Ballade on the Nothingness of Things” opens with the lines: “The big teetotum twirls, /And epochs wax and wane /As chance subsides or swirls ... ” Triskaidekaphobia can be traced back to the Zoroastrianism of ancient Persia where the 13th day of each new year is considered evil, or a day when the power of evil is particularly intense and can cause trouble, thus to this day people leave cities and camp overnight in the countryside. God has\nthirteen\nattributes of mercy according to rabbinic commentary on the Torah, and thirteen is also the number of nodes which make up Metatron’s Cube in Kabbalistic account. Metatron is an extraordinarily important angel in the apocryphal Book of the Palaces; it is suggested that Metatron is the only reason the human race was given knowledge of God and the cube forms a kind of “map of creation.” This appears to relate back to the “rhombohedral monolith” of the early episodes, the college’s strange obelisks. It is worth mentioning that Euclidean spaces generalize to higher dimensions. I feel really weird.",

The Red Flag\n\nThe newspapers said the strikers would hoist\nthe red flag of anarchy over the silk mills\nof Paterson. At the strike meeting, a dyers' helper\nfrom Naples rose as if from the steam of his labor,\nlifted up  his hand and said here is the red flag:\nbrightly stained with dye for the silk of bow ties\nand scarves, the skin and fingernails boiled away\nfor six dollars a week in the dye house.\n\nHe sat down without another word, sank back\ninto the fumes, name and face rubbed off\nby oblivion's thumb like a Roman coin\nfrom the earth of his birthplace dug up\nafter a thousand years, as the strikers\nshouted the only praise he would ever hear.\n\nII. The River Floods the Avenue\n\nHe was the other Valentino, not the romantic sheik\nand bullfighter of silent movie palaces who died too young,\nbut the Valentino standing on his stoop to watch detectives\nhired by the company bully strikebreakers onto a trolley\nand a chorus of strikers bellowing the banned word scab.\nHe was not a striker or a scab, but the bullet fired to scatter\nthe crowd pulled the cork in the wine barrel of Valentino's back.\nHis body, pale as the wings of a moth, lay beside his big-bellied wife.\n\nTwo white-veiled horses pulled the carriage to the cemetery.\nTwenty thousand strikers walked behind the hearse, flooding\nthe avenue like the river that lit up the mills, surging around\nthe tombstones.Blood for blood, cried Tresca: at this signal,\nthousands of hands dropped red carnations and ribbons\ninto the grave, till the coffin evaporated in a red sea.\n\nIII. The Insects in the Soup\n\nReed was a Harvard man. He wrote for the New York magazines.\nBig Bill, the organizer, fixed his good eye on Reed and told him\nof the strike. He stood on a tenement porch across from the mill\nto escape the rain and listen to the weavers. The bluecoats\ntold him to move on. The Harvard man asked for a name to go\nwith the number on the badge, and the cops tried to unscrew\nhis arms from their sockets. When the judge asked his business,\nReed said:Poet. The judge said:Twenty days in the county jail.\n\nReed was a Harvard man. He taught the strikers Harvard songs,\nthe tunes to sing with rebel words at the gates of the mill. The strikers\ntaught him how to spot the insects in the soup, speaking in tongues\nthe gospel of One Big Union and the eight-hour day, cramming the jail\ntill the weary jailers had to unlock the doors. Reed would write:\nThere's war in Paterson. After it was over, he rode with Pancho Villa.\n\nIV. The Little Agitator\n\nThe cops on horseback charged into the picket line.\nThe weavers raised their hands across their faces,\nhands that knew the loom as their fathers' hands\nknew the loom, and the billy clubs broke their fingers.\nHannah was seventeen, the captain of the picket line,\nthe Joan of Arc of the Silk Strike. The prosecutor called her\na little agitator. Shame, said the judge; if she picketed again,\nhe would ship her to the State Home for Girls in Trenton.\n\nHannah left the courthouse to picket the mill. She chased\na strikebreaker down the street, yelling in Yidish the word\nfor shame. Back in court, she hissed at the judge's sentence\nof another striker. Hannah got twenty days in jail for hissing.\nShe sang all the way to jail. After the strike came the blacklist,\nthe counter at her husband's candy store, the words for shame.\n\nV. Vivas to Those Who Have Failed\n\nStrikers without shoes lose strikes. Twenty years after the weavers\nand dyers' helpers returned hollow-eyed to the loom and the steam,\nMazziotti led the other silk mill workers marching down the avenue\nin Paterson, singing the old union songs for five cents more an hour.\nOnce again the nightsticks cracked cheekbones like teacups.\nMazziotti pressed both hands to his head, squeezing red ribbons\nfrom his scalp. There would be no buffalo nickel for an hour's work\nat the mill, for the silk of bow ties and scarves. Skull remembered wood.\n\nThe brain thrown against the wall of the skull remembered too:\nthe Sons of Italy, the Workmen's Circle, Local 152, Industrial\nWorkers of the World, one-eyed Big Bill and Flynn the Rebel Girl\nspeaking in tongues to thousands the prophecy of an eight-hour day.\nMazziotti's son would become a doctor, his daughter a poet.\nVivas to those who have failed: for they become the river.",

    "text": "I was walking from the Louvre to Place Saint-Michel along the Seine when I noticed a crowd gathered under a large linden tree. As I approached I thought how much I’d liked to walk down Unter den Linden when I’d lived in Berlin, and now I saw again how attractive the light green seeds of the linden tree were against the darker green of the leaves. I was also agog to see what had caused the crowd to gather.\nAs I neared I heard a mother say to her little boy, “Regardez, Sébastien, les saltimbanques.”\nSaltimbanques? This was a new word to me. I had a quick look on my iPhone and came up with the translation “mountebank.”  I pushed my way as politely as possible through the crowd until I had a good view. It was a family of street performers. They had improvised a small stage on the wide pavement, and a father, mother, and ten-year-old or so boy were up there. The man was dressed in a striking yellow and blue outfit with white leggings and black shoes, and was banging a little drum rhythmically while the boy in a checked black-and-white jumpsuit capered about, playing thumb rolls on a tambourine, with a black-and-white dog dancing in perfect step alongside him. The woman dressed all in white sat on a stool playing quick dance music on a red tin whistle. On her head was a white floppy hat, sitting on which was a snowy owl who periodically flew in a circle over the heads of the crowd, coming back to land on the white hat. It was a scene worthy of being painted by the young Picasso, or the old Chagall. Or maybe by Gustave Doré. The boy on stage didn’t look in the best of health, but I hoped I was wrong. The effect of the whole performance was strange and utterly charming. And the little troupe seemed to have emerged from another era — from that of Baudelaire, even.\nI was puzzled by the translation offered by my iPhone, however.  What I understood by the English word “mountebank” (which seemed very archaic) was either a person who sold quack medicines in public places, or a charlatan. These performers were no fakes. And yet, the English word, like the French, seemed to suggest the jumping up onto a stage. I’d have to revisit my Shakespeare plays — I seemed to remember that he’d liked using that word.\nWhen the white hat came round I put a €20 note into it, took a quick photograph of les saltimbanques and made my way to the nearest metro. I was almost surprised to see cars and motorbikes clogging the road.",

    "text": "After a Nick Cave “Soundsuit” made from buttons and found vintage abacus\nWhen George Washington became president in\n1789 he had only one tooth in his head, a single\npremolar poking up from his gums. His dent-\nures were fashioned from lead, gold wire springs,\nbrass screws, the teeth of humans and cows, ele-\nphant ivory, and hippopotamus bone. It is a myth\nthat he had false teeth made of wood. A mis-\nperception put forth by those misled by the hair-\nline fractures that ivory and bone possess. Just as\ncherry wine will stain cloth with a rust-hued vein,\nWashington’s fondness for dark wine blemished\nhis teeth. The fractures eventually darkening, un-\ntil resembling the grain in a piece of wood.\nThe darkening of fractures is rather curious.\nThe makeup of the flesh, the constitution of\norigin, the trackers of bloodlines thrown off\nthe trail. It is difficult to determine what discolor-\nations have tunneled their way through the body.\nSpider veins climbing the back of my legs like a\nwinding river mapping the trauma. An unspoken\ncollective of ephemeral bits and bytes, suffering\nmost eloquently preserved in the mouth. The skin\nof one’s teeth decides many a fate. A black woman’s\nincisor settling down inside a white man’s maw.\nOverall, a quizzical look, an off-color joke about\nprogress, the very blood a trick of the eye, an ocean\nblue on the outside of the skin, a blushing\nred if viewed just beneath the sheath.\n\n•\n\n\nA tooth is made up of the crown and the root,\nall the King’s Men destined to revolt. There are\nmany ways to worm your way inside, many open-\nings in the body of an animal. Some orifices gated\nwith white entryways. A wooden portcullis, a pick-\net fence, a laced corset secured tightly by a maid,\na pointed geode just waiting to be pulled, the cavern\nwall glittering in the dark. Sharp crystals ornament\nthe cave’s jawbone.Cave canem, quite naturally speak-\ning. A hooded hole a place for some to hide or go\nseek. A toothless whistle the signal for the slave\nhunting bloodhounds, with canines fanged like\nwater moccasins. The swamp mud gushing like\nthe suppertime mush sloshing between the gums\nof a Confederate soldier. The terror of limbs at\nodds with the self. In World War I, trench foot\nmeant frequent amputations, the blade sliding\nlike floss between each toe. Some diseases attack\nthe foot or mouth, gums left inflamed in the\ncross fire. A grieving mother wears dog tags\naround her neck. Her son’s baby shoes and teeth\ncast in bronze. The pulp at the center is how the\ntooth receives nourishment, how it transmits\nsignals to the brain. The forgetting makes the\npresent tense possible. Memory is the gravity\nof the mind. All the icebergs have started to\nmelt, milky objects left hanging by a\nstring, the doorknobs means to an end.\n\n•\n\n\nThe keyboard’s toothy smile splayed wide,\nthe flatlined cursor blinks impatiently on the\nscreen, my fingers struggle to tap into word\nprocessing. I monitor all of the track changes.\nEven the computer is a slave to death. Its in-\nnards already bygone, its body obsolete upon\nyear of purchase. I am a librarian, swimming the\ndigital divide, my predecessor’s paddles —\na mass of floppy disks in an office closet.\nThey pile up like the teeth of slaves waiting\nfor sale. An affluent businessman at the door,\nhis hands panning the saliva for white gold.\nHis fingers parting the cavity, pursed lips cooing,\nI need something of yours to call my own. The desire\nto chew and smile at will. My grandmother lost\nher mind before her teeth, lost the memories be-\nfore the enamel gave way to rot. My face has my\nmother’s abacus features. We are, in fact, diphyo-\ndont. In one lifetime we develop two sets of teeth.\nThe missing space filled with air, a hollow exile\nbefore the native tongue. I pray my unborn child\nwill have a gap. What the French call “dents du\nbonheur” or lucky teeth. The womb’s peephole is\nrather impressionable. I will fasten the buttons of\ntime. I will take the baby’s body in my own,\nwhisper a plea in its discriminating ear:\nTry to keep your wits about you, my love.\nMemory is about the future, not the past.",

Right now, in fact, they look a wreck, careening hap-\nhazardly along,\ncontriving, as they reach beneath me, to dip a wheel from the curb so\nthat the chair skewers, teeters,\ntips, and they both tumble, the one slowly, almost gracefully sliding in\nstages from his seat,\nhis expression hardly marking it, the other staggering over him, spinning\nheavily down,\nto lie on the asphalt, his mouth working, his feet shoving weakly and\nfruitlessly against the curb.\nIn the storefront office on the corner, Reed and Son, Real Estate, have\ncome to see the show.\nGazing through the golden letters of their name, they're not, at least,\nthank god, laughing.\nNow the buddy, grabbing at a hydrant, gets himself erect and stands\nthere for a moment, panting.\nNow he has to lift the other, who lies utterly still, a forearm shielding his\neyes from the sun.\nHe hauls him partly upright, then hefts him almost all the way into the\nchair, but a dangling foot\ncatches a support-plate, jerking everything around so that he has to put\nhim down,\nset the chair to rights, and hoist him again and as he does he jerks the\ngrimy jeans right off him.\nNo drawers, shrunken, blotchy thighs: under the thick, white coils of\nbelly blubber,\nthe poor, blunt pud, tiny, terrified, retracted, is almost invisible in the\nsparse genital hair,\nthen his friend pulls his pants up, he slumps wholly back as though he\nwere, at last, to be let be,\nand the friend leans against the cyclone fence, suddenly staring up at me\nas though he'd known,\nall along, that I was watching and I can't help wondering if he knows that\nin the winter, too,\nI watched, the night he went out to the lot and walked, paced rather,\nalmost ran, for how many hours.\nIt was snowing, the city in that holy silence, the last we have, when the\nstorm takes hold,\nand he was making patterns that I thought at first were circles, then real-\nized made a figure eight,\nwhat must have been to him a perfect symmetry but which, from where\nI was, shivered, bent,\nand lay on its side: a warped, unclear infinity, slowly, as the snow came\nfaster, going out.\nOver and over again, his head lowered to the task, he slogged the path\nhe'd blazed,\nbut the race was lost, his prints were filling faster than he made them\nnow and I looked away,\nup across the skeletal trees to the tall center city buildings, some, though\nit was midnight,\nwith all their offices still gleaming, their scarlet warning beacons signal-\ning erratically\nagainst the thickening flakes, their smoldering auras softening portions of\nthe dim, milky sky.\nIn the morning, nothing: every trace of him effaced, all the field pure\nwhite,\nits surface glittering, the dawn, glancing from its glaze, oblique, relent-\nless, unadorned.",

And when, at last,\nwe let them go we start to pity them,\nattend their needs: I almost have to think\nto keep my own heart beating through the night.\nI have a wife and four pink boys.

It makes perfect sense\nFor nakedness to give way to frenzy.\nAnd the poems, let’s be clear, were naked.\n\nTime was, questions were put, clear as water.\nThe Goddess bathed, and time was the soft smile\nOf water catching the sunlight on her.\nAnd the sunlight, let’s be clear, was sheer murder.\nInto the same creature, no human word\nLeaps twice. Given to frenzy, nakedness\nSmiles upon the breaking of men and dogs.\n\nHow easy to lose all patience with chaste things!\nChrist, I am hoping to hear from you\nBefore the hunters and suicides make off with me.\nChrist, I am hoping to take your weapons\nTo a tarn freezing in the death of me.\nI shall harry the moon there. I shall halloo.\nBayed in the cross-tree is a lion too.\n\nIn 1969 a red stag made\nA cobweb of moonlight in his antlers.\nFor once in your life, pray without ceasing,\nPray the stag safely by the lion’s tree.\nActaeon never changed. Predator\nIs simply prey to nakedness and reason.\nThe poems have been out hunting all the time.\n\nThen it is Friday. Frisk. You might as well.\nSeeing as the rapeweed, you might as well.\nThe lion is no stranger. The belling\nStag is as familiar as the moon, but a strange\nSuicide. Taken by legs, taken\nBy sinews, kissing the cobwebs of moonlight,\nHe prays the prayer I was not quick to say.\n\nBerries and hoardings, ermine horseplay short\nOf the new, short of poems no longer old\nAs I knew them, leaving the small schools\nFor the main campus rapeweed climbing, pale.\nIt is Friday. Stars won’t cross. Actaeon\nNever imagined the frail, sheer speed\nOf meat. Christ, eat me. Nothing else makes sense.\n\nOn the far\nSafe side of becoming,\nMetaphor\n\nIs all love,\nThe pure being of each\nNude above\n\nPerfect sense.\nI begin to hunt words.\nThe tension\n\nThe soft smile\nOf the Goddess eases\nA short while\n\nReappears\nIn a red stag’s terror.\nMetaphor\n\nLeaps and eats.\nIt is not difficult.\nLove is meat.\n\nThe dogs leap on Actaeon. He is human.\nI begin to think of Time as anything\nIn the gift of humans or as sacrifice\nTo the long uplift of lions in the blood.\nNow dogs tear deeply into the living flesh.\nEach moment is a visible agony,\nAnd still the godly human nature remains\n\nUnharmed. I never imagined the sheer frail\nOf fear so powerful. Legs and sinews turn\nInto flowers. Between her breasts, the Goddess\nShelters one such, one blood violet alive.\nThe porch of heaven is littered with color.\nAs familiar as the moon, our humanness\nCrosses into heaven as the new poem.\n\nOn the far side of becoming, a life’s work\nBegins another kind of work, but naked\nOf change. There are animals, water and trees.\nNothing is recognizable in its old\nSkin, yet everything shimmers. I am afraid,\nShrinking from the teeth of the cold water\nAnd from the howling trees. I perish at this point\n\nDown among dogs and upwards beside lion.\nThe pieces of me are carried fast away\nBy plot and rhyme. See Artemis bathing.\nThe moonlight on her body is the mother\nOf God. It makes perfect sense. I am eaten\nAnd fed changeless into her breast, blood\nViolet alive. I remain your friend.",

Give me back my rusty sword.\nThough I thought the wars were done,\nThough I thought our peace was won,\nYet I signed the Declaration, and the dead must keep their word.\n\n“There’s only one great ghost I know could make that ’larum ring.\nIt’s the captain that we knew\nIn the ancient buff and blue,\nIt’s our Englishman, George Washington, who fought the German king!”\n\nSo the sunset saw them mustering beneath their brooding boughs,\nAncient shadows of our sires,\nKindling with the ancient fires,\nWhile the old cracked Bell to southward shook the shadowy meeting house.",

No more, sir; that will do.\"\nSo, for the time, apparently it did,\nAnd Eben evidently thought so too;\nFor soon amid the silver loneliness\nOf night he lifted up his voice and sang,\nSecure, with only two moons listening,\nUntil the whole harmonious landscape rang—\n\n\"For auld lang syne.\" The weary throat gave out,\nThe last word wavered; and the song being done,\nHe raised again the jug regretfully\nAnd shook his head, and was again alone.\nThere was not much that was ahead of him,\nAnd there was nothing in the town below—\nWhere strangers would have shut the many doors\nThat many friends had opened long ago.",

Plus, you'll have enough left over to use as your own personal lubricant (a true Pacific dinner date). Why didn't you tell me about the \"In Honor of Guam's Liberation\" SPAM*! I'm trying to collect them all! Once I was on a diet and SPAM* faded from my consciousness. Then I met my future wife, who's Hawaiian, and SPAM* became part of my life again (a true Pacific romance). Maybe the economic downturn will help people appreciate SPAM* instead of loathing it. SPAM* doesn't have to be unhealthy; I eat SPAM* every day and I'm not dead, yet—just switch to SPAM* Lite. Despite rumors, SPAM* is NOT made of such odds and ends as hooves, ears, brains, native peoples, or whole baby pigs. The name itself stands for Specially Processed Army Meal, Salted Pork And More, Super Pink Artificial Meat, Snake Possum And Mongoose, or Some People Are Missing. My uncle is the reigning Guam SPAM* king. He won the last SPAM* cook off with his Spicy SPAM* meatballs. I will never forget the two-pound SPAM* bust of George Washington he made for Liberation Day, toasted crispy on the outside with raw egg yolk in the hollow center— the kids loved it! Only a fool would start a company in Guam that provides SPAM* protection. For Xmas, I bought a snow globe featuring a can of SPAM* sitting on an island. Turn it over and a typhoon swirls madly, unable to unseat SPAM* from its place of honor. I have a souvenir can I bought after seeing Monty Python's SPAM*ALOT on Broadway in New York City.

It wasn’t\nThat she was less willing to be helped to walk\nBut that the walking itself had become less willing.\nMaybe the stupid demogorgon blind\nRecalcitrance of body, resentful of the laws\nOf mind and spirit, was getting its own back now,\nOr maybe a new and subtle, alien,\nIntelligence of body was obedient now\nTo other laws: “Weight is the measure of\nThe force with which a body is drawn downward\nTo the center of the earth”; “Inertia is\nThe tendency of a body to resist\nProceeding to its fate in any way\nOther than that determined for itself.”\n\nThat evening, at the Bromells’ apartment, after\nShe had been carried up through the rational structure\nBy articulate stages, floor after flashing floor,\nAnd after we helped her get across the hall,\nAnd get across the room to a chair, somehow\nWe got her seated in a chair that was placed\nA little too far away from the nearest table,\nAt the edge of the abyss, and there she sat,\nExposed, her body the object of our attention—\nThe heaviness of it, the helpless graceless leg,\nThe thick stocking, the leg brace, the medical shoe.\n\nAt work between herself and us there was\nA new principle of social awkwardness\nAnd skillfulness required of each of us.\nOur tones of voice in this easy conversation\nWere instruments of marvelous finesse,\nMeasuring and maintaining with exactitude\n“The fact or condition of the difference\nThere was between us, both in space and time.”\n\nHer smiling made her look as if she had\nJust then tasted something delicious, the charm\nHer courtesy attributed to her friends.\n\nThis decent elegant fellow human being\nWas seated in virtue, character, disability,\nBehind her the order of the ranged bookshelves,\nThe windows monitored by Venetian blinds—\n“These can be raised or lowered; numerous slats,\nHorizontally arranged, and parallel,\nWhich can be tilted so as to admit\nPrecisely the desired light or air.”\n\nWe were all her friends, Maggie, and Bill, and Anne,\nAnd I, and the nice Boston Brahmin elderly man\nNamed Duncan, utterly friendly and benign.\nAnd of course it wasn’t whether or not the world\nWas benign but whether it looked at her too much.\nShe wasn’t “painfully shy” but just the same\nI wouldn’t be surprised if there had been\nPainfulness in her shyness earlier on,\nSay at dancing school. Like others, though, she had\nSurvived her childhood somehow. Nor do I mean\nShe was unhappy. Maybe more or less so\nBefore her marriage. One had the sense of trips\nArranged, committees, concerts, baffled courage\nLiving it through, giving it order and style.\nAnd one had the sense of the late marriage as of\nTwo bafflements inventing the sense they made\nTogether. The marriage seemed, to the outside world,\nAnd probably was, radiant and triumphant,\nAnd I think that one could almost certainly say\nThat during the last, heroic, phase of things,\nAfter his death, and after the stroke, she had\nBy force of character and careful management,\nMaintained a certain degree of happiness.\n\nThe books there on the bookshelves told their stories,\nLine after line, all of them evenly spaced,\nAnd spaces between the words. You could fall through the spaces.\nIn one of the books Dr. Johnson told the story:\n“In the scale of being, wherever it begins,\nOr ends, there are chasms infinitely deep;\nInfinite vacuities...For surely,\nNothing can so disturb the passions, or\nPerplex the intellects of man so much,\nAs the disruption of this union with\nVisible nature, separation from all\nThat has delighted or engaged him, a change\nNot only of the place but of the manner\nOf his being, an entrance into a state\nNot simply which he knows not, but perhaps\nA state he has not faculties to know.”\n\nThe dinner was delicious, fresh greens, and reds,\nAnd yellows, produce of the season due,\nAnd fish from the nearby sea; and there were also\nAshes to be eaten, and dirt to drink.",

And to the crows, manic\non the thermals? A crescent of their planet,\n\ngone to sudden sun. I watched one stutter\npast the fence line, then settle\non a Hereford's tufted nape,\nas if to peck some safer grain, as if\nthe red-cast back it rode\ncontained no transformations.\n\n\n2.\n\nA seepage, then, from the fire's edge: there\nand there, the russet flood of rabbits.\nOver the sounds of burning, their haunted calls\nbegan, shrill and wavering, as if\ntheir dormant voice strings\nhad tightened into threads of glass.\n\nIn an instant they were gone—the rabbits,\ntheir voices—over the fire trench,\ninto the fallows. My father walked\nnear the burn line, waved up to me, and from\nthat wave, or the rippled film of heat,\n\nI remembered our porch in an August wind,\nhow he stepped through the weathered doorway,\nhis hand outstretched with some\nbook-pressed flower, orchid or lily, withered\nto a parchment brown.\nHere,\nhe said, but\nas he spoke it atomized before us—\npulp and stem, the pollened tongue,\ndreadful in the dancing air.\n\n\n3.\n\nScummed and boxcar thin,\nsix glass-walled houses stretched beside our fields.\nInside them, lilies, lilies—\n\na thousand shades of white, I think.\nEggshell, oyster, parchment, flax.\n\nFar down the black-mulched beds, they seemed\nancestral to me, the fluted heads of\ndowagers, their meaty, groping,\nsilent tongues. They seemed\nto form perspective's chain:\ncinder, bone, divinity. . .\n\n\n4.\n\nMy father waved. The crows set down.\nBy evening, our fields took the texture\nof freshened clay, a sleek\nand water-bloated sheen, although no water\nrested there—just heat and ash\nunited in a slick mirage. I crossed the fence line,\ncircled closer, the grasses all around me\ncollapsing into tufts of smoke. Then as I bent\nI saw the shapes, rows and rows of tougher stems—\n\nbrittle, black, metallic wisps, like something grown\nto echo grass. The soot was warm,\nthe sky held smoke in a jaundiced wing,\nand as a breeze crossed slowly through,\nstems glowed—then ebbed—\nconsecutively. And so revealed a kind of path,\nand then a kind of journey.",

The cool\nInstructors must keep eyes and ears\nOpen. Accidents out there, they happen.\n\nYou might imagine scraps\nOf cultural débris, a broken pot, a ring, a cogwheel\nCome up, clutched in a palm, and interesting,\nA wave pattern in it, the blade of a sword,\nWhen a lucky diver breaks again the surface. Time,\nTime and again frigate and schooner cracked\nBlown against the rocks, holed below the water line.\n\nEven an inscription\nMight now be coming up from those green deeps.\nYet the divers do their silent thing. On the sea floor\nExpect only the sea, a multitude of sand without an hourglass.\nRound somebody’s ankle idly it swarms. A diver\nHangs by a thread of breath in solitude there. Some go down\nIn all simplicity curious; to have tales to tell;\nAnd who knows, what they learn\nJust might, long after this, be usable.",

As a visual poet, he brings a vibrant literary sense to the text as visual object. He has arrayed phrases and individual words upon a field that takes the form of a traditional chess set, compelling the reader to construct meaning out of the various ways a string of words can be constructed. The reader can read up, down, diagonally, and even in a continuous spiral. In the end, the poem becomes a textual movie—every block upon the page a single frame in that movie—and the film flickers before us, sending our minds in different directions, exciting the retina, and teasing the mind. Meaning is not easy or certain in this visual poem. Instead, it surges toward us and swirls away, both brazen and coy.

The dogs\nwere sleeping at her feet where time was also sleeping,\ncalm and unmoving as in all photographs.\n\nI wiped the dust from my mother’s face.\nIndeed, dust covered everything; it seemed to me the persistent\nhaze of nostalgia that protects all relics of childhood.\nIn the background, an assortment of park furniture, trees and shrubbery.\n\nThe sun moved lower in the sky, the shadows lengthened and darkened.\nThe more dust I removed, the more these shadows grew.\nSummer arrived. The children\nleaned over the rose border, their shadows\nmerging with the shadows of the roses.\n\nA word came into my head, referring\nto this shifting and changing, these erasures\nthat were now obvious—\n\nit appeared, and as quickly vanished.\nWas it blindness or darkness, peril, confusion?\n\nSummer arrived, then autumn. The leaves turning,\nthe children bright spots in a mash of bronze and sienna.\n\n\n2\n\nWhen I had recovered somewhat from these events,\nI replaced the photograph as I had found it\nbetween the pages of an ancient paperback,\nmany parts of which had been\nannotated in the margins, sometimes in words but more often\nin spirited questions and exclamations\nmeaning “I agree” or “I’m unsure, puzzled—”\n\nThe ink was faded. Here and there I couldn’t tell\nwhat thoughts occurred to the reader\nbut through the bruise-like blotches I could sense\nurgency, as though tears had fallen.\n\nI held the book awhile.\nIt was Death in Venice(in translation);\nI had noted the page in case, as Freud believed,\nnothing is an accident.\n\nThus the little photograph\nwas buried again, as the past is buried in the future.\nIn the margin there were two words,\nlinked by an arrow: “sterility” and, down the page, “oblivion”—\n\n“And it seemed to him the pale and lovely\nsummoner out there smiled at him and beckoned...”\n\n\n3\n\nHow quiet the garden is;\nno breeze ruffles the Cornelian cherry.\nSummer has come.\n\nHow quiet it is\nnow that life has triumphed. The rough\n\npillars of the sycamores\nsupport the immobile\nshelves of the foliage,\n\nthe lawn beneath\nlush, iridescent—\n\nAnd in the middle of the sky,\nthe immodest god.\n\nThings are, he says.

Today\n\nToday, this moment, speechlessly in pain,\nHe fights the terror of being poured out,\nThe fall into darkness unquenchably long\nSo that even as he hurtles he keeps holding\n\nBack like a dam the flood overtops—but nothing now\nCan stop that surge, already he swirls\nTo the source of Voices, the many throats inside the one\nThroat, each swallowing the unstoppable flood ...\n\nAnd as if that, all along, were what he'd wanted,\nHe hears the Voices begin to die down\nThe way a marsh in spring pulsing and shrilling\nSunup to sundown falls gradually still\n\n—Unappeasable, the silence that will follow\nWhen his every last drop has been poured out.\n\n\n2. Countdown\n\nIn your hospital bed, the plastic mask across\nYour face siphoning air into your lungs,\nYou lie helpless as an astronaut\nBlasting into space: Eyes oblivious\n\nTo ours, your body's fevered presence\nShimmers like the phantom heat that will trail\nUp the pipe of the crematory oven:\nHow distant we will seem after\n\nSuch intensity ... We drift in your stare\nLike the dust stirred by the cow your parents\nGave you as a boy to teach responsibility.\n\nAlready you are space immeasurable\nBy your slide rule, your graphs that plotted\nPayload, liftoff, escape velocity.\n\n\n3. Prayer\n\nIn the house of the dead I pace the halls:\nThe walls, collapsing, stretch away in desert\nOr flatten into horizonless ocean.\nI step outside, the door clicking shut\n\nComforting in its finality ...\nNow I see the house as if I looked down\nFrom far off mountains, and saw you crouching in\nThe sun-scoured yard, eyes keenly focused,\n\nPupils narrowing to a cat's green slits:\nI can't look you in the face, you see only\nThe openness of sky rising above mountains.\n\n(Only after the world had emptied\nYou and filled you with its openness\nWill I feel the love I pray to feel?)\n\n\n4. The God\n\na dream\n\n\nA warming pulsing flood like blood surging through\nVeins, and now the god stirs in my hands\nDull as stone in this gravity-less Nowhere.\nSensation shivering through me, deliberate and sure,\n\nI cradle you, I sponge you clean\nAs if you were\nmy\nson, the emptiness you\nDrink like heavy black milk erasing\nYour wrinkles and gouged lines of pain.\n\nThe god bends me to the work, my fingers driven\nBy the god, blinded by the god's\nNeutrality, until I pull apart the threads\nIn this place the god commands:\n\nFace wholly unwoven, without heart, mind, you\nare nothing in my hands but my hands moving.\n\n\n5. His Stare\n\nAbsently there in a moment of pure being\nHe sits in his chair, eyes locked, staring:\nThe air's transparence gains solidity\nFrom his looking; while his emaciated features,\n\nThe way his flesh sags from sharpening cheekbones,\nMake the summer air weigh like marble on the harsh green\nOf the trees he is too weak to prune.\nAnd yet the contemplative distance he is sealed in\n\nProjects with ferocious purpose the will of his body\nTo withdraw into this eerily removed contemplation\nLike one who has heard a tuning fork ringing\nAnd enters and becomes each spectral vibration;\n\nSo utterly absorbed that love is a distraction; even\nThe world, its barest colors, bleeding away before that stare.\n\n\n6. The Current\n\nThe numbing current of the Demorol\nSweeps him out to sea where the secret night\nHe lives in slowly begins to darken,\nHis daytime routine of watching his blood cycle\n\nThrough the tubes of a machine shadowed by blackness\nBlinding as an underwater cave. Already\nHe filters the dark water through gills aligned\nTo strain that element he more and more resembles:\n\nLike walls of water held in miraculous\nSuspension, the moment of his death looms impartially\nAbove him, my hands holding his tightening\nIts grip even as his hand loosens ...\n\nAs if my hand could lead him past that undulating\nWeight towering above us out of sight.\n\n\n7. The Rehearsal\n\nI lead you back, your Orpheus, until you\nStand inhaling, on the topmost stair,\nThe rank rich air of breathing flesh—\nBut like fumes rising from earth's molten core\n\nThe voices of the dead reach out to you,\nYour whispering parents, dead for forty years,\nEntreating me to turn—and so I\nTurn, as must you: Your footsteps die,\n\nYou dwindle, blur into unfillable\nSpace echoing like the dark of a cathedral ...\nBut there is no dark, no stair, no Orpheus\n\n—Only this voice rehearsing breath\nBy breath in words you'll never read these\nLines stolen from your death.",

Whole families shopping at night! Aisles full of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the tomatoes!—and you, Garcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons?\n\nI saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.\nI heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops? What price bananas? Are you my Angel?\nI wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, and followed in my imagination by the store detective.\nWe strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never passing the cashier.\n\nWhere are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in an hour. Which way does your beard point tonight?\n(I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel absurd.)\nWill we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade to shade, lights out in the houses, we'll both be lonely.\nWill we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past blue automobiles in driveways, home to our silent cottage?\nAh, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher, what America did you have when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out on a smoking bank and stood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of Lethe?\nBerkeley, 1955",

We have\nbeen dreaming of a place\nin the country lately and I’m\nnone too sure that is very healthy.\nAnd speaking of health that’s\nalso been a problem that probably\nhas something to do with no money,\nsince we’ve all been sick lately,\ntaking turns politely of course.\nCould you bring me some more\ntea one of us will ask,\nand the other will.\nIn between the coughing and\nworrying our thoughts\nhave often turned to crime.\nWe seriously wonder how we can\nget away with a bundle with\nas little risk as possible.\nLast week we took our last\n$12 out of the bank\nand noticed how much more\nthey had there though\nwe had none. Of course\nwe wouldn’t rob that bank,\nthey know us there\nas the ones who bring\nthe rolls of pennies in.\nAnd just yesterday they\nfish-eyed us for trying\nto cash our son’s xmas bond\nfrom his grandparents\nafter only one month.\nSo we wouldn’t try to rob that bank,\nbut I do know of one up north\nthat may be possible. . .\nI know this just seems like\nromantic dreaming\nbut I practically make a career\nof reading detective stories,\nand God knows, I have no other.\nAnyway if the right opportunity\ncomes along, we are more\nthan ready to meet it.\nBut this is a time of waiting,\nthe I Ching says, though it does\nnot say how we are to eat\nwhile waiting. And soon\nwe will have another mouth to feed—\nAnn now in her seventh month,\nand that is often in our thoughts.\nBesides all that we are both\nover thirty, artist and poet,\nstill waiting to cross the great water.\nMeanwhile, day after day,\nthere is still Detroit\nto be dealt with — a small pond\nsays our friend Snee.\nBig fish we used to answer him,\nbut that was a while back.\nNow we think maybe Lake Erie\nis the great water referred to\nin the I Ching, and if we wait\nlong enough we can\nwalk across — to Buffalo\nor Cleveland. In a healthy person,\nsays the philosopher, self-pity\ncan be a forerunner to action:\nonce the problem is seen clearly,\na solution may be found at hand.\nAnd as I said, I think it is interesting\nthough not exactly amusing.",

    "text": "I walked along Rue du Faubourg du Temple on the way to Belleville and I stopped at a shop selling rat poison. To my astonishment and my amusement they had a window full of stuffed rats, including four small rats standing round a table, playing cards. I liked that very much. Paris was full of weird turnarounds, it seemed — poisoning and elevating the rats to art at the same time. I nearly went in and asked how much the four rats and the tiny table would cost, but I remembered I’d be going back to Ireland pretty soon, and the people at airport security might not see the joke.\nIt was not the first time I’d seen rat poison on sale here. Paris seemed to have a problem with rats. Someone I’d met for lunch recently had said she’d seen them running around the Métro platform when she was coming home once around midnight. I remembered a rat had made a dramatic appearance in one of Baudelaire’s little poems in prose. A rich boy had lost interest in his expensive toy because he’d seen a poor boy poking a rat in an improvised cage. I’m pretty sure that wasn’t an invention on Baudelaire’s part — lots of poor parents probably thought of giving their children (or at least, their sons) rats as pets. Hadn’t I had a pet mouse myself? The rich boy who’d seen the rat certainly was delighted at the idea of having the creature as a pet.\nMany years ago a friend of mine who worked as a chef gave me his original copy of Larousse Gastronomique— an edition first published in the 1920s or 30s. In there, I think, was a recipe called Cassoulet de Grand Souris. This was basically rat meat given the coq au vin or boeuf bourguignon treatment, i.e. cooked in red wine with mushrooms and tiny onions. I can’t remember which top Parisian restaurant introduced the dish onto their menu during the Siege of Paris in 1870–71, but apparently it proved very popular. It made sense too, as the Siege lasted for more than four months, and no meat was getting in, while rats were plentiful, then as now. I seem to recall the menus of the time sometimes also included rat salami, and a rat sauce called Sauce Robert. It’s no use looking in a current edition of Larousse as the book has been cleaned up — all mention of rats have been removed.\nI had some experience of rats when I was a child in Donegal.  I commonly saw water rats swimming in the stream or small river that flowed behind my primary school. The house I grew up in had rats under the floorboards. I used to love spending time under the stairs, and sometimes the rats would come in through a hole in the back. I don’t remember ever having been afraid of them but I never touched them or wanted them to walk on top of me. And I certainly never thought of capturing one and making it my pet.

    "text": "This is for the Pullman Porters who organized when people said\nthey couldn’t. And carried the Pittsburgh Courier and the ChicagoDefender to the Black Americans in the South so they would\nknow they were not alone. This is for the Pullman Porters who\nhelped Thurgood Marshall go south and come back north to fight\nthe fight that resulted in Brown v. Board of Education because\neven though Kansas is west and even though Topeka is the birth-\nplace of Gwendolyn Brooks, who wrote the powerful “The\nChicago Defender Sends a Man to Little Rock,” it was the\nPullman Porters who whispered to the traveling men both\nthe Blues Men and the “Race” Men so that they both would\nknow what was going on. This is for the Pullman Porters who\nsmiled as if they were happy and laughed like they were tickled\nwhen some folks were around and who silently rejoiced in 1954\nwhen the Supreme Court announced its 9—0 decision that “sepa-\nrate is inherently unequal.” This is for the Pullman Porters who\nsmiled and welcomed a fourteen-year-old boy onto their train in\n1955. They noticed his slight limp that he tried to disguise with a\ndoo-wop walk; they noticed his stutter and probably understood\nwhy his mother wanted him out of Chicago during the summer\nwhen school was out. Fourteen-year-old Black boys with limps\nand stutters are apt to try to prove themselves in dangerous ways\nwhen mothers aren’t around to look after them. So this is for the\nPullman Porters who looked over that fourteen-year-old while\nthe train rolled the reverse of the Blues Highway from Chicago to\nSt. Louis to Memphis to Mississippi. This is for the men who kept\nhim safe; and if Emmett Till had been able to stay on a train all\nsummer he would have maybe grown a bit of a paunch, certainly\nlost his hair, probably have worn bifocals and bounced his grand-\nchildren on his knee telling them about his summer riding the\nrails. But he had to get off the train. And ended up in Money,\nMississippi. And was horribly, brutally, inexcusably, and unac-\nceptably murdered. This is for the Pullman Porters who, when the\nsheriff was trying to get the body secretly buried, got Emmett’s\nbody on the northbound train, got his body home to Chicago,\nwhere his mother said: I want the world to see what they did\nto my boy. And this is for all the mothers who cried. And this is\nfor all the people who said Never Again. And this is about Rosa\nParks whose feet were not so tired, it had been, after all, an ordi-\nnary day, until the bus driver gave her the opportunity to make\nhistory. This is about Mrs. Rosa Parks from Tuskegee, Alabama,\nwho was also the field secretary of the NAACP. This is about the\nmoment Rosa Parks shouldered her cross, put her worldly goods\naside, was willing to sacrifice her life, so that that young man in\nMoney, Mississippi, who had been so well protected by the\nPullman Porters, would not have died in vain. When Mrs. Parks\nsaid “NO” a passionate movement was begun. No longer would\nthere be a reliance on the law; there was a higher law. When Mrs.\nParks brought that light of hers to expose the evil of the system,\nthe sun came and rested on her shoulders bringing the heat and\nthe light of truth. Others would follow Mrs. Parks. Four young\nmen in Greensboro, North Carolina, would also say No. Great\nvoices would be raised singing the praises of God and exhorting\nus “to forgive those who trespass against us.” But it was the\nPullman Porters who safely got Emmett to his granduncle and it\nwas Mrs. Rosa Parks who could not stand that death. And in not\nbeing able to stand it. She sat back down.",

Commune\nBriefly with your ignorant heart\nFor those bewildered raging children\nEurope surrenders her old gentry to.\n\nAll their eyes turn in the night from\nYour fretfulness and forgetfulness,\nYour talk; they turn away, friend.\nTheir eyes dilated with dreams of power\nFix on the image of the mob wet\nWith blood scaling the gates of order.\nAnarchist and incendiary\nCaesar bind that brotherhood\nTo use and crush the civil guard,\nDebauch the debauché, level\nTenement and court with soaring\nSideslipping squadrons and hard regiments,\nStripped for the smoking levée of the\nHowitzer, thunderstruck under the net.\n\nThe great mouth of hunger closes\nOn swineherd and princess, on the air\nOf jongleur and forest bell; Grendel\nSwims from the foul deep again.\nDeputy, cartelist, academician\nQuestion in haste any plumeless captain\nBefore the peremptory descent\nOf mankind, flattered and proud.\nWith whitening morning on the waste\nYou may discern through binoculars\nA long line of the shawled and frozen,\nMoving yet motionless, as if those\nWere populations whom the sun failed\nAnd the malicious moon enchanted\nTo wander and be still forever\nThe prey of wolves and bestial mazes.",

I’d just returned\nfrom my debauched year up north—sad, drunken\nsex at the baths, in dark parks. You still yearned\nfor St. David’s, your stint as a foreign\nexchange student. In Wales, something fearless\nwoke you up: you drank, wrote, fucked. Now, stuck in\nthe suburbs, we talked poets, punk rock. This\nwas the late seventies, disco’s zenith.\nWe both wanted to look like Patti Smith.\n\nWe both wanted to look like Patti Smith\non her Horses album: disheveled, pale,\nthin, intense. You were scanning Meredith’s\n“Modern Love” for British Lit. I thought stale\nanyone before Sexton. You laughed, threw\nback your head. I puffed a Marlboro Light.\nIn truth, you were too hearty, and I too\nuptight, to do punk. I praised, as twilight\ndimmed the gray valley, a poem you’d read\nat the student reading: a pitcher cracks,\nforeshadows a car crash. The skyline bled\nbehind you. I’d also read that night—racked\nwith stage fright, trembling uncontrollably.\nYou seemed at ease, more confident than me.\n\nYou seemed at ease, more confident than me,\nmore independent. Lived on Amigo\nAvenue with a roommate, a moody\nscience major; and your alter ego,\na tomcat named Baby Tubbs. Still at home,\nI had no wheels. You drove a battered white\nhatchback full of newspapers, beer cans, comb,\nbrush, books—half wastebasket, half purse. One night\nearly on, we split a fifth of scotch, spread\nyour tarot cards on the living room floor.\nYou predicted long life for me, then said\nof yourself: “I might make twenty-five.” Your\nroommate walked by, shot a look. Later, I\npassed out beneath Lord Byron’s watchful eye.\n\nPassed out beneath Lord Byron’s watchful eye—\nthe poster tacked above your secondhand\ncouch—I dreamt I was falling down the side\nof a mountain, a scarecrow, twisted and\nlimp, limbs ripped, bouncing from rock to rock. On\nevery wall an idol: Toulouse-Lautrec\ncancan in kitchen, young Chatterton’s wan\nfigure over your desk. Shuffling the deck,\nyou asked the same question, drew the same black\ncard: Death. Together we consulted all\nyour oracles: Ouija board, zodiac,\nI Ching, palm, a fickle Magic 8 Ball.\nHoping for more time, you inquired, believed\nlike a convict praying for a reprieve.\n\nLike a convict praying for a reprieve,\nyou were more alive than the complacent\nsuburbanites I despised. Drunk and peeved\nat the world, I started an argument\nthat ended with you hurling a full Coors\nat me as I fumed down your stairs. Four weeks\npassed before we spoke, a rift I endured\nby writing a poem about the freak-\nish night a black cloud followed us—we lit\ncandles, toasted oblivion. Battle\nscarred, we entered the undergraduate\npoetry contest at Northridge. Daniel\nHalpern guest judged...or was it May Swenson?\nAfter your death, I’d be happy you won.\n\nWhat can you say about a twenty-five-\nyear-old girl who died? That as a child she\nloved horses. And dogs. And cats. That Monty\nPython made her laugh. That she was alive\nto the disruptions of her time. That she\nliked Byron, Rod Stewart, Mozart, Waugh, Poe,\nKeats, the Cars. That she lived on Amigo\nand was my friend. That she once threw her keys\nin anger; once threw a New Yorker, shout-\ning “I hate John Ashbery!” And that she\nonce, after a speed- and scotch-fueled orgy—\nSome Girls blasting, her last boyfriend passed out\nbeside us—straddled, rode me like a horse.\nRachel, can I say this: your cunt felt coarse.\n\nAfter your death, I’d be happy you won\nthe contest—at least you had that. “Don’t turn\non me,” you pleaded. Losing wasn’t fun,\nbut I couldn’t begrudge you your prize. Burned\nout from an abortion, a vicious bite—\na German shepherd lunged at your nose, slit\nits tip—and a violent unrequit-\ned affair with your “Don J,” a closet\ncase obsessed with Kerouac, you spoke of\nmaking a change. By then it was summer:\nBlondie on the car radio, Fourth of\nJuly, craving fireworks. I remember\nheadlights; reaching for the steering wheel, you.\nNext thing I knew, I woke in ICU.\n\nNext thing I knew, I woke in ICU:\nmachines beeping around me, doctors and\nnurses hovering in an eerie blue\nlight. Tube down my throat, I scrawled, with bruised hand,\nyour name, question mark. My sister was steered\nin, wept to tell you were dead. The night they\nmoved me to a private room, you appeared,\npulsating white presence, in the hallway\noutside my door. “I’m all right,” you said, “You\ndon’t have to worry about me.” I’d lie\nthere in traction for six weeks, almost two\ndecades ago, a ghost that fell from my\nown scarecrow dream, numb to that deadly drop.\nThe first time we talked was on a rooftop.",

A nod, or silence,\nanother nod, consent—or not, as a cloud\ndrifts beyond the scene and the two\nstand pointing in different directions\nat the very same empty sky.\nEven so, there was something\nelse about the story, like teaching\na stunt to an animal—a four-legged\ncreature might prance on two legs\nor a two-legged creature might\nfall onto four.\nI remembered,\nthen, the miscarriage, and before that\nthe months of waiting: like baskets filled\nwith bright shapes, the imagination\nrun wild. And then what arrived:\nthe event that was nothing, a mistaken idea,\na scrap of charred cloth, the enormous\npresent folding over the future,\nlike a wave overtaking\na grain of sand.\nThere was a myth\nI once knew about twins who spoke\na private language, though one\nspoke only the truth and the other\nonly lies. The savior gets mixed\nup with the traitor, but the traitor\nstays as true to himself as a god.\n\nAll night the rain falls here, falls there,\nand the creatures dream, or drown, in the lair.",

    "text": "I was born in Boston in\n1949. I never wanted\nthis fact to be known, in\nfact I’ve spent the better\nhalf of my adult life\ntrying to sweep my early\nyears under the carpet\nand have a life that\nwas clearly just mine\nand independent of\nthe historic fate of\nmy family. Can you\nimagine what it was\nlike to be one of them,\nto be built like them,\nto talk like them\nto have the benefits\nof being born into such\na wealthy and powerful\nAmerican family. I went\nto the best schools,\nhad all kinds of tutors\nand trainers, traveled\nwidely, met the famous,\nthe controversial, and\nthe not-so-admirable\nand I knew from\na very early age that\nif there were ever any\npossibility of escaping\nthe collective fate of this famous\nBoston family I would\ntake that route and\nI have. I hopped\non an Amtrak to New\nYork in the early\n‘70s and I guess\nyou could say\nmy hidden years\nbegan. I thought\nWell I’ll be a poet.\nWhat could be more\nfoolish and obscure.\nI became a lesbian.\nEvery woman in my\nfamily looks like\na dyke but it’s really\nstepping off the flag\nwhen you become one.\nWhile holding this ignominious\npose I have seen and\nI have learned and\nI am beginning to think\nthere is no escaping\nhistory. A woman I\nam currently having\nan affair with said\nyou know  you look\nlike a Kennedy. I felt\nthe blood rising in my\ncheeks. People have\nalways laughed at\nmy Boston accent\nconfusing “large” for\n“lodge,” “party”\nfor “potty.” But\nwhen this unsuspecting\nwoman invoked for\nthe first time my\nfamily name\nI knew the jig\nwas up. Yes, I am,\nI am a Kennedy.\nMy attempts to remain\nobscure have not served\nme well. Starting as\na humble poet I\nquickly climbed to the\ntop of my profession\nassuming a position of\nleadership and honor.\nIt is right that a\nwoman should call\nme out now. Yes,\nI am a Kennedy.\nAnd I await\nyour orders.\nYou are the New Americans.\nThe homeless are wandering\nthe streets of our nation’s\ngreatest city. Homeless\nmen with AIDS are among\nthem. Is that right?\nThat there are no homes\nfor the homeless, that\nthere is no free medical\nhelp for these men.And women.\nThat they get the message\n—as they are dying—\nthat this is not their home?\nAnd how are your\nteeth today? Can\nyou afford to fix them?\nHow high is your rent?\nIf art is the highest\nand most honest form\nof communication of\nour times and the young\nartist is no longer able\nto move here to speak\nto her time…Yes, I could,\nbut that was 15 years ago\nand remember—as I must\nI am a Kennedy.\nShouldn’t we all be Kennedys?\nThis nation’s greatest city\nis home of the business-\nman and home of the\nrich artist. People with\nbeautiful teeth who are not\non the streets. What shall\nwe do about this dilemma?\nListen, I have been educated.\nI have learned about Western\nCivilization. Do you know\nwhat the message of Western\nCivilization is? I am alone.\nAm I alone tonight?\nI don’t think so. Am I\nthe only one with bleeding gums\ntonight. Am I the only\nhomosexual in this room\ntonight. Am I the only\none whose friends have\ndied, are dying now.\nAnd my art can’t\nbe supported until it is\ngigantic, bigger than\neveryone else’s, confirming\nthe audience’s feeling that they are\nalone. That they alone\nare good, deserved\nto buy the tickets\nto see this Art.\nAre working,\nare healthy, should\nsurvive, and are\nnormal. Are you\nnormal tonight? Everyone\nhere, are we all normal.\nIt is not normal for\nme to be a Kennedy.\nBut I am no longer\nashamed, no longer\nalone. I am not\nalone tonight because\nwe are all Kennedys.\nAnd I am your President.",
