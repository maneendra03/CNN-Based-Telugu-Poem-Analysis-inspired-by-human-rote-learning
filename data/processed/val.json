Little as it is, pitiful as it seems,\nthis is what they were given, and they don’t want to lose it.\n\nThe gawky and the slow, the motley and the misshapen…\nWhat bliss to be walking in their midst as if I were one of them,\njust ride this gentle wave of idiocy, forget those who profess\nan interest in my welfare, look passing strangers in the eye\nfor something we might have in common, and be unconcerned if nothing’s there.\nAnd now we peek into a dark café, and now we mug at the waitress\nwhose feet are sore, whose smile makes up for the tacky carnations\nand white uniform makes it easy to mistake her for a nurse,\neven makes it necessary, given the state of the world.\n\nAnd when the giant with three teeth harangues us to hurry up,\nwhat comfort to know he’s a friend, what pleasure to be agreeable,\nsmall wonders of acquiescence, like obedient pets. Except animals\ndon’t have our comic hope, witless as it is. They don’t get\nto wave madly at the waitress, as though conducting a symphony\nof ecstatic expectations. If I turned and lived with animals\nI’d only be a creature of habit, I’d go to where the food is\nand the warmth. But I wouldn’t get to say to my troubled friend,\n“Your eyes are so beautiful. I could live in them.”",

Is it true that they dream?\n\nIt is true, for the spaces of night surround them with shape and purpose, like a warm hollow below the shoulders, or between the curve of thigh and belly.\nThe land itself can lie like this. Hence our understanding of giants.\nThe wind and the grass cry out to the arms of their sleep as the shore cries out, and buries its face in the bruised sea.\nWe all have heard barns and fences splintering against the dark with a weight that is more than wood.\nThe stars, too, bear witness. We can read their tails and claws as we would read the signs of our own dreams; a knot of sheets, scratches defining the edges of the body, the position of the legs upon waking.\nThe cage and the forest are as helpless in the night as a pair of open hands holding rain.\n\n2. Do they dream of the past or of the future?\n\nThink of the way a woman who wanders the roads could step into an empty farmhouse one afternoon and find a basket of eggs, some unopened letters, the pillowcases embroidered with initials that once were hers.\nThink of her happiness as she sleeps in the daylilies; the air is always heaviest at the start of dusk.\nCows, for example, find each part of themselves traveling at a different rate of speed. Their bells call back to their burdened hearts the way a sparrow taunts an old hawk.\nAs far as the badger and the owl are concerned, the past is a silver trout circling in the ice. Each night he swims through their waking and makes his way back to the moon.\nClouds file through the dark like prisoners through an endless yard. Deer are made visible by their hunger.\nI could also mention the hopes of common spiders: green thread sailing from an infinite spool, a web, a thin nest, a child dragging a white rope slowly through the sand.\n\n3. Do they dream of this world or of another?\n\nThe prairie lies open like a vacant eye, blind to everything but the wind. From the tall grass the sky is an industrious map that bursts with rivers and cities. A black hawk waltzes against his clumsy wings, the buzzards grow bored with the dead.\nA screendoor flapping idly on an August afternoon or a woman fanning herself in church; this is how the tails of snakes and cats keep time even in sleep.\nThere are sudden flashes of light to account for. Alligators, tormented by knots and vines, take these as a sign of grace. Eagles find solace in the far glow of towns, in the small yellow bulb a child keeps by his bed. The lightning that scars the horizon of the meadow is carried in the desperate gaze of foxes.\nHave other skies fallen into this sky? All the evidence seems to say so.\nConspiracy of air, conspiracy of ice, the silver trout is thirsty for morning, the prairie dog shivers with sweat. Skeletons of gulls lie scattered on the dunes, their beaks still parted by whispering. These are the languages that fall beyond our hearing.\nImagine the way rain falls around a house at night, invisible to its sleepers. They do not dream of us.\n\n4. How can we learn more?\n\nThis is all we will ever know.",

Could sweet nothings\nclear the world free of blood fear? Of sweet-faced\nMugoo and Gugoo in a threadbare pleading, “Do not\n\npart us.” From their mild rhetoric and politic of Love\nthe hills and valleys had swooned into blossoms of\nheaven, and had set the scene with gaudiest cheeks.\n\nSo who dare part them?

And you have to question a guy like that: trading in a sweet stripper for me. Not a homemaker. Not home much at all. Not sweet. More like my grandfather, Jimmy Grieco. Mean. My mother likes to describe the blue-sky day when she bought me a helium balloon and I let it go. I was six. I begged for another. She said,okay, but, if you let this one go, I’m really going to be mad. I nodded, took the string in my hand, held tight, and then opened my hand flat so the balloon lifted and its string slipped up and away.You were never sweet, my mother says.\n***\nIn Vegas, a few weeks ago, Jimmy and I sorted photographs in his double-wide just off Boulder Highway. My mother stood on the sidelines. She hates how I ask Jimmy for the hard stories. Tell me about the moonshine. Tell me about the dead kids. Tell me how your mother saved the family by burning down the farm. Jimmy’s crooked finger points to a picture of the family. That was Leonard.He was deaf and dumb. Died at twelve. That was Vincent.The baby who fell off the staircase without a rail. Dead at two. Then there's his mother, surrounded by her children.She was tough, he says.Tough. When Chicago’s Black Hand demanded ten thousand dollars, she stuffed five grand in her apron, grabbed my grandfather—then five—and took him to deliver the money.That's all you'll ever get, she said,and don’t touch my kids or I’ll kill you.\n***\nMy grandfather never asks about the first or second wife. I don’t have to tell him that ballerina-fable. He knows I’m three and mean. He knows it for his whole life. His first, my grandmother, was like sugar. He burned her, abandoned her in LA, raced to Mexico, paved road turning to dirt; he ate prickly pear, maybe, on the way to his quick divorce. And, though he won’t tell this story, his own father lived, first, with a sweet woman on a wheat farm, far south in Craco, Italy. He boarded a ship, told his wife he’d send for her, and then fled to New York. And in an apartment on Mulberry Street, he met up with the new girlfriend and they disappeared into their new world. She wasn’t pretty.She was tough. She got busted twice for making moonshine. Her sons loved her. She was mean.",

I scour, sweep, and dust.\nI hope you don’t think of me\nAs a runaway? I remember your kindness,\nYour lessons in reading and writing on the piazza.\nMy journey was unusual. I saw some of the war\nAnd it was terrible even far up into the North.\nMy first fright was at a train depot outside Memphis\nWhere some soldiers found me eating not yet ripened\nQuinces and grapes, they took me prisoner: first\nI helped some children carry tree limbs to the woodbox\nOf the locomotive, then, I was shown to a gentleman\nIn the passenger car who was searching for his runaway\nNegress in a purple dress; he wouldn’t identify me,\n\nAnd I was thrown in with about forty stray blacks into\nAn open boxcar and soon we were moving, next to me\nA man was sucking on the small breasts of a girl\nMaybe twelve years of age, across from them\nA sad old woman smiled as she puffed on an old cigar end,\nBy afternoon she was dead, her two friends\nJust kicked her out so that she rolled down into pasture\nFrightening some hogs that ran off into a thicket.\nThe girl next to me whimpered and shook. Those quinces\nJust ran straight through me and all I could do was\nSquat in one corner that was supplied with ammonia-waters\nAnd hay. We were given that night Confederate uniforms\nTo mend and when the others slept I dressed in three\nShirts and trousers and leapt from the moving train,\nThe padding helped some but I couldn’t walk the next day.\nI hid in a shack that seemed lonely but for a flock\nOf turkeys, some young hens, and a corncrib with tall\nSplit palings. The next morning from a hill\nI watched field-workers on a tobacco plantation, it took\nTwo men to carry a single leaf like a corpse from\nA battle scene. That night I found a horse with a bit\nIn its mouth made of telegraph wire. He carried me up all\nThe way to Youngstown.Chloe, you must\nLearn to swim in the pond and to ride the old sorrel.",

The artificer\nOf quiet, distance holds me in a vise\nAnd holds the ocean steady to my eyes.\n\nOnce when I rounded Flattery, the sea\nHove its loose weight like sand to tangle me\nUpon the washing deck, to crush the hull;\nSubsiding, dragged flesh at the bone. The skull\nFelt the retreating wash of dreaming hair.\nHalf drenched in dissolution, I lay bare.\nI scarcely pulled myself erect; I came\nBack slowly, slowly knew myself the same.\nThat was the ocean. From the ship we saw\nGray whales for miles: the long sweep of the jaw,\nThe blunt head plunging clean above the wave.\nAnd one rose in a tent of sea and gave\nA darkening shudder; water fell away;\nThe whale stood shining, and then sank in spray.\n\nA landsman, I. The sea is but a sound.\nI would be near it on a sandy mound,\nAnd hear the steady rushing of the deep\nWhile I lay stinging in the sand with sleep.\nI have lived inland long. The land is numb.\nIt stands beneath the feet, and one may come\nWalking securely, till the sea extends\nIts limber margin, and precision ends.\nBy night a chaos of commingling power,\nThe whole Pacific hovers hour by hour.\nThe slow Pacific swell stirs on the sand,\nSleeping to sink away, withdrawing land,\nHeaving and wrinkled in the moon, and blind;\nOr gathers seaward, ebbing out of mind.",

At length my trance\nWas cancell'd, stricken thro' with doubt.\n\nVague words! but ah, how hard to frame\nIn matter-moulded forms of speech,\nOr ev'n for intellect to reach\nThro' memory that which I became:\n\nTill now the doubtful dusk reveal'd\nThe knolls once more where, couch'd at ease,\nThe white kine glimmer'd, and the trees\nLaid their dark arms about the field:\n\nAnd suck'd from out the distant gloom\nA breeze began to tremble o'er\nThe large leaves of the sycamore,\nAnd fluctuate all the still perfume,\n\nAnd gathering freshlier overhead,\nRock'd the full-foliaged elms, and swung\nThe heavy-folded rose, and flung\nThe lilies to and fro, and said\n\n\"The dawn, the dawn,\" and died away;\nAnd East and West, without a breath,\nMixt their dim lights, like life and death,\nTo broaden into boundless day.",

Even then when she cried and no matter what\nand no matter and no matter and no matter and no matter what,\nI held her all night if she cried so she would not ever know\nsomeday you’ll cry alone, but I held her and ached and leaked\nand bled too as long as it took. Of course there’ve been nights\nsince but sometimes it feels as if I’ve never been asleep again,\nso when I say I pushed my two-year-old against a wall and I don’t\nremember it happening that way but it happened and I did\nand I’ve been wondering a long time now what the limit is\nand when I would find the end of myself, and that day, which\nwas yesterday, was the end.

The Chihuahua Desert\n\nI rose early to wash the desert grime, watch\nthe unearthly flight of doves, the way pigeons\nwere poisoned incorrectly or how an elephant\nwas beaten with a stick. This is the way\n\nof beginnings, women charmed by fits of language,\nthe cadence of bees around garbage cans,\nthe laughter of grackles, hot sun baking Coca-Cola\nto sidewalks. Tumbleweeds and arroyos hush\n\nday-long trips through barrios.\nI am sand. My eyes grainy, tears brown,\nand what of the different tones of bees or flies,\nhow a sting can kill us?\n\nI’m speaking the language of smokers,\nlung-full and wary, breathing a refinery chore,\nmy eyes black pits, Historically\n\nI was fruit, voluptuous and campy, some might say\nexotic, cheekbones native, my hips swaying.\n\nII. The Rio Grande\n\nI grew into the silence of third person, a landscape,\na mesa. I flew hard into the silence of gray smog,\nmy chest burning, my throat dry with the songs\nof women with sagging faces, children\nstrapped to their bent backs.\n\nThey have become a river metaphor, a border,\na soulless chant to believers. Maquiladora workers slain\nand buried in shallow graves. My palms refuse\nto fold in prayer and god giggles in my red ears.\n\nSand pecks my skin like a drum roll in the hot wind.\nThe march of children, their backpacks plastic,\nthe way they see color a mystery, a dance, the shapes\nof clouds, an elephant, a dove, a long-lost dog. They sing\nsong their way past the factory-circus.\n\n\nIII. The Potomac\n\nYears later I loved a blank-faced man in tweed\nwho drank espresso and ate bagels in a deli outside\nWashington D.C. His pale face mirrored in the glass\nat a video-store where he grumbled artless\nand unfilled by the hurried ache\n\nof cicadas. His first and last job in the world\nof mundane labor. He was all red hair;\nhis voice bellowed.\n\nWas it the seventh or tenth year he dubbed\nmy language, subtitled my screens? Windows\non the metro metalled sand tunneled.\n\nI lost the desert dance of blood, half-forgot\nthe closed copper mine, the way the border’s earth\nis lead-filled and sullen.\n\nIV. The Vlatva\n\nAwed by cathedrals in Paris, then Prague,\nI was the archangel of rage with my book-bag,\na wordless hum. I began to speak with my hands,\n\nmy eyes Slavic dark, searching. I worshipped\nfat swans along the thick river taking in the green\nwondering why I had been blessed by such beauty.\n\nI sensed him in a snowdrift of words historically\ndivine. And what was he or I in this world? I didn’t see\nthe gold specks in his eyes, the way poetry\n\nbecame his glory, full of fan-fare and the strife\nof strip malls. And here, envying his pristine days,\nthe way the books never cover his mouth,\nour hearts pump separately to the rhythm of loss.",

Her unstartled gaze\nBeads on him like a sniper’s sights, until\nAt the clean report of a cracking poplar branch,\nShe leaps away like luck, over rapid water,\nAnd snowfall scrims the scene like a mist of tears,\nLike a migraine, like sweat or blood streaming into your eyes.",

He looks full of hope;\na woman I’ve never seen before at his side. Welcome home,\n\nI tell my wife. She’s just turned twenty-four. I’m childless,\nfatherless.

More metal.\nNeptune is bitch-sobbing in my rearview,\nand I got my running shoes on and all this sky that’s all mine.\n\nFuck your order. Fuck your time. I realigned the cosmos.\nI chaosed all the hell you have yet to feel. Now all your kids\nin the classrooms, they confused. All their clocks:\nwrong. They don’t even know what the fuck to do.\nThey gotta memorize new songs and shit. And the other\nplanets, I fucked their orbits. I shook the sky.

A fool is what I feel, you\nunderstand, cause I motored over to Pig Burton’s\nstore near The Bottle and asked him—he was\nstacking feed sacks on Robert Ring’s vehicle—\nwho the hell was the target king of Beat Three.\nPig always has his hands in every pie; he’d\nknow if some individual had been hauling off all\nthe turkey shoot prizes. I know I should know,\ntoo, but a sheriff’s got beaucoup chores\nto do, mostly idiot paperwork. I’ve lost\ntouch since the last bond vote hired me four new\ndeputies, all dirt-dumb. Well, old Pig has\nthat laugh he can’t hold back, and he points\nhis finger pistol-like at Robert, who’s got\na shamed look on his face. “Pow,” he says\nat me or Bob, looking back and forth, just\n“Pow.” Seems Bob’s boy Earl, the one\nthat ain’t got the sense of a chicken under\nthat cowlick red as a rooster comb, is known\nto have sneaked Bob’s Colt a week before\nand shot every yellow sign he could till his pa\nran him down and whacked him good,\nthen locked him in the fall-down curing shed\novernight—he’s a hard man, but he loves\nthat boy. I remember once ... but how the hell\ncan any half-wit you wouldn’t trust to milk\nhit the bull by the eye first time he ever gets\nloose with a handgun? “It’s easy,” says Bob,\nless shamed than afraid now he’ll have to pay\nfor fresh metal—his people have always\nbeen tight—but he’s showing a grin I don’t like.\n“Real easy. He just cuts loose from the hip,\nfive short feet back, sometimes maybe six,\nand comes back later to paint the target circles\nwheresomever his bullet hits. He aims that\npaintbrush right smart.” Blessed if I don’t\nfeel the fool for being full dumbstruck\nat a trick Earl’s not bright enough to see\nas a joke. But I didn’t write it up nor charge\na soul, just ground my cigar in the dirt\nand helped myself to a Dr. Pepper, made believe\nit didn’t mean a thing, but all day I’ve been\nriding, listening to crime reports on state radio—\nrobbery at the mall, attempted rape maybe, wrecks\non the bypass and a set fire in Brill’s deer woods.\nIt gets to be too much. I shouldn’t even take\nthe time to sit here watching this dark space\nwhere folks have been dancing all evening,\nhearing the quiet after all those raucous songs,\nbut Alton, don’t you see, the feeble boy’s right,\nor half right, at least? It all comes to the same,\nwhether you get what you want in the end or\nwant what you get. The law works that way:\neach law makes more crime, but it’s not my job\nto say. Warm up my cup just one last time.\nI’ve got to circle Ampex once more before\nI turn it home. God, this dark feels right,\nno matter what flowers out there shed spring\nlight. The dark is what hits me as holy.\nI’m calling it a day. Catch you later. Night.",

Often you must have seen them\nLoaded with ice a sunny winter morning\nAfter a rain. They click upon themselves\nAs the breeze rises, and turn many-colored\nAs the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.\nSoon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells\nShattering and avalanching on the snow-crust—\nSuch heaps of broken glass to sweep away\nYou'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.\nThey are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,\nAnd they seem not to break; though once they are bowed\nSo low for long, they never right themselves:\nYou may see their trunks arching in the woods\nYears afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground\nLike girls on hands and knees that throw their hair\nBefore them over their heads to dry in the sun.\nBut I was going to say when Truth broke in\nWith all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm\nI should prefer to have some boy bend them\nAs he went out and in to fetch the cows—\nSome boy too far from town to learn baseball,\nWhose only play was what he found himself,\nSummer or winter, and could play alone.\nOne by one he subdued his father's trees\nBy riding them down over and over again\nUntil he took the stiffness out of them,\nAnd not one but hung limp, not one was left\nFor him to conquer. He learned all there was\nTo learn about not launching out too soon\nAnd so not carrying the tree away\nClear to the ground. He always kept his poise\nTo the top branches, climbing carefully\nWith the same pains you use to fill a cup\nUp to the brim, and even above the brim.\nThen he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,\nKicking his way down through the air to the ground.\nSo was I once myself a swinger of birches.\nAnd so I dream of going back to be.\nIt's when I'm weary of considerations,\nAnd life is too much like a pathless wood\nWhere your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs\nBroken across it, and one eye is weeping\nFrom a twig's having lashed across it open.\nI'd like to get away from earth awhile\nAnd then come back to it and begin over.\nMay no fate willfully misunderstand me\nAnd half grant what I wish and snatch me away\nNot to return. Earth's the right place for love:\nI don't know where it's likely to go better.\nI'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,\nAnd climb black branches up a snow-white trunk\nToward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,\nBut dipped its top and set me down again.\nThat would be good both going and coming back.\nOne could do worse than be a swinger of birches.",

I resolve to settle the matter once and for all. The man on my stoop holds a shovel in one hand and  in the other, his hat. An old pillowcse stuffed with something bulky—empty beer cans?—rests on the welcome mat at his feet. For twenty bucks, he offers to clear the front walk. Behind him, snowy steps descend to an icy path winding between a dead hydrangea and the Subaru parked, as usual, a little too close to  the fence. My husband, I recall, will not be home until late. The forecast tonight is more snow. I show the man the contents of my wallet—two crumpled fives and one single—which he accepts, bowing slightly. I nod and withdraw behind the locked door. Eleven dollars, I reflect as I return to the keyboard with my tepid kombucha, isn’t bad for a half-hour’s effort. If he works fast, he could be done in twenty minutes. When I take a cupcake break in the kitchen moments later, however, I spy him out the sliding glass door, dragging his shovel behind him down the street, my icy walkway, to all appearances, untouched. Fair enough, I say, jangling my pajama pocket full of loose change.\n☽\n\nPillow is a funny word, Her Majesty announces in the rosy glow of  her nightlight. So is Word. She sits up wide-eyed and smiles.Word is a funny word, she repeats. So is Funny! So is Goodnight,  I intone from the doorway, and dissolve in the dark.\n\n☽\n\nGuilty Pleasures\n\nBeating a child at checkers.\nPeeing in swimming pools.\nWatching Dateline.\nDrinking milk from the carton.\nGlimpsing one’s neighbor at home in her curlers.\nGlimpsing one’s neighbor at home in her curlers, watching\nDateline, drinking milk from the carton.\nA roaring fire in July.\n\n☽\n\nQuestionable Gestures\n\nTo haggle with hookers.\nTo roast a bride.\nTax-deductible gifts.\nTo supplement a hunger strike with juice.\nA post-doc at Yale School of Medicine’s Center for Obesity\nResearch sponsored by Pizza Hut.\nGolden parachutes.\nFaux fur.\nBlush on a corpse.\n\n☽\n\nLast night I had a dream so vivid I didn’t bother to record it on my pillow. I was sipping a large stein of sangria at some sort of nightmarish gala, leaning on the arm of a once-powerful older man I’d met in college, upon whom I was now, in the dream, in the awkward position of passing literary judgment. He was wearing a white guayabera shirt with pink stitching, and what hair of his remained was slicked across a forehead speckled with age. I woke angry and aroused and could not get back to sleep. Was this a Prophetic Dream? A Psychological Healing Dream? A Belief Dream? The only option I could rule out for certain was a Dream of Daily Life.\n\n☽\n\nIncongruous\n\nA vegan in Vegas.\nA poor plastic surgeon.\nTempests with names like “Trudy” and “Ted.”\nPerfume at a funeral.\nMilitary dolphins.\nBlack balloons.\nLight rock.\n\n☽\n\nI read a message last night from a woman I have yet to meet beyond the dim glow of a list-serv. She lives in Tampa, if memory serves, and won a juried prize last year for a mixed-media meditation on habitat loss across America, including charts, chants, photographs, oral histories, crowdfunded films, and salvaged trash. She tracks the migratory patterns of purple martins above Wal-Mart parking lots and graphs the spawning grounds of Northern leopard frogs from the Gulf Stream waters to the redwood forests. She posts quarterly reports on her blog. She now finds herself, she confessed last night, in the unfamiliar position of lacking words. While dropping off her child at preschool yesterday, she explained,  she learned from a social worker stationed in the foyer about the sudden death, on Wednesday night, of a boy in the class. An accident at home, is all she knows. The details remain undisclosed. The toddlers have been told that ther friend now lives inside their hearts. What does that mean, her daughter wants to know. What does it mean that he is in our hearts? She doesn’t want Sam inside her, her daughter insists. Sam picks his nose. She doesn’t want Sam’s boogies polluting her heart. At a loss for words myself, I don’t reply. I sit at Her Majesty’s bedside that night and watch snowy pillows pile upon the peeling deckhairs outside.\n\n☽\n\nBetter By Moonlight\n\nEquestrian statues.\nLandfills.\nThe Grand Canyon.\nSex after forty.\nLawn furniture.\nTravel plans.\nBeethoven’s Moonlight Sonata.",

She came to my gas fire\nAnd lay before it, sprawled, her pure bare shoulders\nFolded in a doze, a clear, cold curve of stone.\n\nI only leaned above the hair,\nTurned back the quilt, arranged the feet, the arms,\nAnd kissed the sleeping shoulder, lightly, like the rain;\nAnd when she woke to wear her weathered clothes,\nI sent her home.\nShe floated, a blue blossom, over the street.\n\nAnd when she came again,\nIt was not long before she turned to me,\nAnd let her shawl slide down her neck and shoulder,\nLet her hair fall.\nAnd when she came again,\nIt did not rain.\n\nHer husband came to pluck her like an apple,\nAs the drunken farmer lurches against the tree,\nGrips the green globe not long beyond its bloom,\nAnd tears the skin, brutally, out of the bark,\nLeaves the whole bough broken,\nThe orchard torn with many footprints,\nThe fence swung wide\nOn a raw hinge.\n\nAnd now it is said of me\nThat my love is nothing because I have borne no children,\nOr because I have fathered none;\nThat I twisted the twig in my hands\nAnd cut the blossom free too soon from the seed;\nThat I lay across the fire,\nAnd snuffed it dead sooner than draft or rain.\n\nBut I have turned away, and drawn myself\nUpright to walk along the room alone.\nAcross the dark the spines of cactus plants\nRemind me how I go—aloof, obscure,\nIndifferent to the words the children chalk\nAgainst my house and down the garden walls.\nThey cannot tear the garden out of me,\nNor smear my love with names. Love is a cliff,\nA clear, cold curve of stone, mottled by stars,\nsmirched by the morning, carved by the dark sea\nTill stars and dawn and waves can slash no more,\nTill the rock’s heart is found and shaped again.\n\nI keep the house and say no words, the evening\nFalls like a petal down the shawl of trees.\nI light the fire and see the blossom dance\nOn air alone; I will not douse that flame,\nThat searing flower; I will burn in it.\nI will not banish love to empty rain.\n\nFor I know that I am asked to hate myself\nFor their sweet sake\nWho sow the world with child.\nI am given to burn on the dark fire they make\nWith their sly voices.\n\nBut I have burned already down to bone.\nThere is a fire that burns beyond the names\nOf sludge and filth of which this world is made.\nAgony sears the dark flesh of the body,\nAnd lifts me higher than the smoke, to rise\nAbove the earth, above the sacrifice;\nUntil my soul flares outward like a blue\nBlossom of gas fire dancing in mid-air:\nFree of the body’s work of twisted iron.",

You don't have to starve\nIn Provo but you eat at your own risk.\nAt no risk. I would never have gone to Provo\nOn my own. I went accompanied—\nFor reasons almost too trivial—or personal—to mention.\n\n\nThere are moments when you simply must get into the car and drive\nAnd from Salt Lake there are only a few ways to go,\nToward the Great Salt Lake or toward the canyons and to get\nTo Zion or Moab you had to pass through Provo.\n\n\nI remember the population because it went\nWith the number of miles from outskirt to outskirt,\n45 miles, 45,000 people, 45 minutes\n(Keeping to the speed limit)\n$45 to spend on a suit at a 45% discount...\n\nThere was nothing Provo's department store did not carry,\nIncluding pearl handled Colt 45's,\nBut for a wider selection of fire arms, rifles\nWith narrowing focal points, with greater precision over vast distances,\nYou were better off\nNext door.\n\n\nO I guess it wasn't that different from entering\nA thousand other American towns, but this one\nMade my flesh crawl. I wanted to howl.\n\nThe men walked with their hands deep in their pockets.\nThe women were afraid to lift their eyes.\nIt was as if something terrible had happened\nOr was about to happen.\n\n\nI'm not saying you have to love what you do\nIn this life, but it isn't nice to practice\nThe silent treatment on strangers in the desert,\nStrangers who would have to be wondering\nWhere the other 44,990 people were, since\nOther than the one drowning potatoes in burning oil\n\nBeside the grill in the luncheonette\nAnd the one behind the register,\nAnd the three grim-faced, parchment-skinned\nJack Mormons hunkered over cups,\nAnd the handful of impassive faces\nPlaced against the windows\nOf one-story cinder-block houses,\n\nThere was no one in Provo beyond the jackrabbits—\nGlimpsed in abundance en route—\nWho vanished as we crossed the town line,\nAnd drove past the population sign.\n\nOr was it a warning in disguise?\n\n\nThere was something eerie in the air,\n\nAn absence I could not identify.\n\n\nAn immense single-pump gas station,\nShimmering like a mirage in the heat,\nTook up a good part of the main drag.\nI pull in. Step into the heat stunned.\nThe car is too hot to touch.\nI needed gas but didn't want to get it there.\nIt meant digging up the attendant.\n\nYou know the lights in hospital corridors,\nThose are the lights in the gas station in Provo.\nThey're the kind of lights that show up whatever's wrong with a face;\nThe kind of lights that make something wrong when there's nothing\nwrong.\n\n\nWhen I got there, I was afraid. It's hard\nTo put my finger on the precise reason why.\nIt's not as though something ominous rose\nFrom the sidewalks or Hell's Angels cycles\nWere parked outside the luncheonette.\nNothing like that.\n\nNor can I say why, even though there was almost\nNo one on the street, I felt watched.\n\nWhile I slept fitfully in the tilt-back bucket seats,\nSomeone scribbled obscenities on the headlights.\n\nI felt drawn by destiny to this nadir.\n\n\nYou don't want to provoke anyone in Provo.\nIt's that kind of place, that kind of absence—\n\nThe desert flattens out, the plants\nDraw in their antennae.\n\nProvo is not where you can hope to find\nBoon companions.

Under the bison\nA straight line giving him a ground to stand on\nReads\nFIVE CENTS\n. And on the other side of our nickel\nThere is the profile of a man with long hair\nAnd a couple of feathers in the hair; we know\nSomehow that he is an American Indian, and\nHe wears the number nineteen-thirty-six.\nRight in front of his eyes the word\nLIBERTY\n, bent\nTo conform with the curve of the rim, appears\nTo be falling out of the sky\nY\nfirst; the Indian\nKeeps his eyes downcast and does not notice this;\nTo notice it, indeed, would be shortsighted of him.\nSo much for the iconography of one of our nickels,\nWhich is now becoming a rarity and something of\nA collectors’ item: for as a matter of fact\nThere is almost nothing you can buy with a nickel,\nThe representative American Indian was destroyed\nA hundred years or so ago, and his descendants’\nRelations with liberty are maintained with reservations,\nOr primitive concentration camps; while the bison,\nExcept for a few examples kept in cages,\nIs now extinct. Something like that, I think,\nIs what Keats must have meant in his celebrated\nOde on a Grecian Urn.\nNotice, in conclusion,\nA number of circumstances sometimes overlooked\nEven by experts: (a) Indian and bison,\nConfined to obverse and reverse of the coin,\nCan never see each other; (b) they are looking\nIn opposite directions, the bison past\nThe Indian’s feathers, the Indian past\nThe bison’s tail; (c) they are upside down\nTo one another; (d) the bison has a human face\nSomewhat resembling that of Jupiter Ammon.\nI hope that our studies today will have shown you\nSomething of the import of symbolism\nWith respect to the understanding of what is symbolized.",

Since then\n(which was last night, November 3rd, 2009), I’ve been thinking\nabout where I am more, as a kind of goal,\nand somewhat less about where I’m not. It’s a pleasure to be\nwhere one is, given that someone\nisn’t somewhere lethal. This is Pleasure One.\n\nAnd now this is Pleasure Two, thinking about it,\nso that this place, which was Place One, and a pleasure,\nas we were there where we were and it was not a lethal place,\nbut a place where we were, is now this place again\nas we’re here thinking about it, like America or a popsicle.\n“Open the house and the house is empty,” Natalie also said, meaning\nher dollhouse, as she’s seven, but when she said it, I had this\nvision of all of us suddenly disappearing, maybe thinking\nourselves ghosts, even, or getting somewhere, out\nand around her bedroom and then down the hall and stairs.\n\nI’ll tell you how it happened. Natalie and I were looking out the window\nat the backyard, and she asked me if I liked our house. It’s a theme\nwith her. The other night she asked me if I liked life. I said, “Yeah,\na lot.” And she looked at me a second and then said, “Me too.”\nYou don’t hear that every day, I think, until the accumulations\nbegin to remind me of every day: Carla, who donated a kidney\nto her brother-in-law (Robin’s uncle), has just been diagnosed\nwith cancer, two months later. She sends hopeful updates\nfrom the hospital, on Facebook. Like fountains, the footnotes\ngo on. My footnote or yours. The big questions can’t be decided\nin this way. They demand coins or laws.

No, that’s not the difference: rather, how\n\nConvinced he was he should be added to!\nWhy did he think adding meant increase?\nTo me it was dilution. Where do these\nInnate assumptions come from? Not from what\nWe think truest, or most want to do:\nThose warp tight-shut, like doors. They’re more a style\nOur lives bring with them: habit for a while,\nSuddenly they harden into all we’ve got\n\nAnd how we got it; looked back on, they rear\nLike sand-clouds, thick and close, embodying\nFor Dockery a son, for me nothing,\nNothing with all a son’s harsh patronage.\nLife is first boredom, then fear.\nWhether or not we use it, it goes,\nAnd leaves what something hidden from us chose,\nAnd age, and then the only end of age.",

The house you grew up in is on fire. There is a gigantic trebuchet on fire on the edge of a crater and the crater is on fire. There is a complex system of tunnels deep underneath the surface with only one entrance and one exit and the entire system is filled with fire. There is a wooden cage we’re trapped in, too large to see, and it is on fire. There are jaguars on fire. Wolves. Spiders. Wolf-spiders on fire. If there were people. If our fathers were alive. If we had a daughter. Fire to the edges. Fire in the river beds. Fire between the mattresses of the bed you were born in. Fire in your mother’s belly. There is a little boy wearing a fire shirt holding a baby lamb. There is a little girl in a fire skirt asking if she can ride the baby lamb like a horse. There is you on top of me with thighs of fire while a hot red fog hovers in your hair. There is me on top of you wearing a fire shirt and then pulling the fire shirt over my head and tossing it like a fireball through the fog at a new kind of dinosaur. There are meteorites disintegrating in the atmosphere just a few thousand feet above us and tiny fireballs are falling down around us, pooling around us, forming a kind of fire lake which then forms a kind of fire cloud. There is this feeling I get when I am with you. There is our future house burning like a star on the hill. There is our dark flickering shadow. There is my hand on fire in your hand on fire, my body on fire above your body on fire, our tongues made of ash. We are rocks on a distant and uninhabitable planet. We have our whole life ahead of us.",

We cannot bathe here.”\n\nWe walked on until we reached an inlet.  There we saw, standing on a white rock, a man holding a bejeweled box, from which he took sugar and threw it into the sea.\n\n“And this is the optimist,” said my soul, “And he too must not see our naked bodies.”\n\nFurther on we walked.  And on a beach we saw a man picking up dead fish and tenderly putting them back into the water.\n\n“And we cannot bathe before him,” said my soul.  “He is the humane philanthropist.”\n\nAnd we passed on.\n\nThen we came where we saw a man tracing his shadow on the sand. Great waves came and erased it.  But he went on tracing it again and again.\n\n“He is the mystic,” said my soul, “Let us leave him.”\n\nAnd we walked on, till in a quiet cover we saw a man scooping up the foam and putting it into an alabaster bowl.\n\n“He is the idealist,” said my soul, “Surely he must not see our nudity.”\n\nAnd on we walked.  Suddenly we heard a voice crying, “This is the sea.  This is the deep sea.  This is the vast and mighty sea.” And when we reached the voice it was a man whose back was turned to the sea, and at his ear he held a shell, listening to its murmur.\n\nAnd my soul said, “Let us pass on.  He is the realist, who turns his back on the whole he cannot grasp, and busies himself with a fragment.”\n\nSo we passed on.  And in a weedy place among the rocks was a man with his head buried in the sand.  And I said to my soul, “We can bath here, for he cannot see us.”\n\n“Nay,” said my soul, “For he is the most deadly of them all.  He is the puritan.”\n\nThen a great sadness came over the face of my soul, and into her voice.\n\n“Let us go hence,” she said, “For there is no lonely, hidden place where we can bathe.  I would not have this wind lift my golden hair, or bare my white bosom in this air, or let the light disclose my sacred nakedness.”\n\nThen we left that sea to seek the Greater Sea.",

    "text": "On the platter set out in the center of the Matyó-embroidered tablecloth\nwas the syringe. And around it was silence. My father\ngazed at my mother, and she back at him. Slowly,\nfaltering, he began to speak. I was seized by\nan unusual shuddering. I recall that he used the word fate,\nand that if   I consented to the injected dose,\nwe could all fall asleep. We would stay together\nfor all time. And evade the uncertainty in mortifying\ndesperation. A fifteen-year-old’s desire to live\ncried out in me: “No!” To which\nmy father stated: “If you want to live, then\nwe too must keep on living, because we can’t leave you\nby yourself.” My father was the village doctor. I grew up\nwith no siblings. My mother’s sister lived next door,\nwith her husband and two children, Nelly and Gyurika.\nIn the evenings I prayed: “Merciful Lord of mine,\nMy eyes have closed, but thine, yet still are open, father mine,\nWatch over me as I recline.” Then this: “In one God\nI believe, in one homeland I believe, in the eternal\ndivine truth I believe, in Hungary’s re-\nsurrection I believe. Amen.” Gyuri could not study in Pest,\nhe went to Brünn. Later, not even there. Then the family\nsent him to Toulouse. My mind could not comprehend. Then\none of uncle Vilmos’s servants murdered him with six ax-blows.\nHe screamed crazed into the courtyard: “That’s what\nthe stinking   Jew deserved!” I found him, his head smashed open.\nI ran to my father, who didn’t even believe it. And one after\nthe other, the horrors came. Nelly lived in Újvidék\nwith her husband. Uncle Ernő was in the middle of shaving when\nHungarians broke into the flat. They were looking for the family.\nThe nanny quickly threw a quilt onto six-month-old Tomika,\nthey didn’t notice him. Peterke was out with Nelly. Uncle Ern\nő\n\nwas executed on the ice of   the Danube. Nelly did not recover.\nShe knitted pullovers, each more beautiful than the next, so as not\nto feel the pain. She went to Pest to learn a trade,\nso she could support her children. That’s how it was when\nnineteen-forty-four came. On March 15, one of my teachers said,\n“You remain seated,” while the class sang the Anthem,\n“and be quiet.” On the day of the nineteenth, the Germans\ninvaded. From then on, it was obligatory to wear the star.\nThrough the intervention of the medical officer and the Lord Lieutenant, my father\ncould have stayed out. I had to move to the ghetto with my mother. My\nfather said “The family should stay together.” All up and down\nour street they stood, to bid farewell. Father acknowledged\nthem, but already he was just waiting\nfor the end. He had aged by decades. Then the injection,\nthe one I already spoke of, turned up on the table with the\nMatyó embroidery. We sat in the evening underneath the open sky\nbefore being loaded onto the freight cars. The doctor from the next village\ndrank mercury chloride with his wife. Despite my father’s stomach lavage,\nthey succumbed by the morning. There were eighty of us in the wagon.\nAn expectant mother gave birth on the way. But with no water, my father\ncould not save them. There were those who went mad in the freight cars.\nMy father taught me always to say “Ich will\narbeiten.” On the seventh of   July the train stopped. Father read\nthe plaque, Auschwitz-Birkenau, and said, “We are\nlost!” Megaphones blared, “Leave your packages\nin the wagons, they will be brought to you later. Special vehicles\nare coming for the sick and the elderly, just remain sitting,”\nthey repeated, “everything will be fine. Men exit\nthe wagon to the left, women to the right.” As farewell,\nmy papa said, “Always be my clever, my obedient, my good\nlittle girl...    ” That is how we parted for eternity. Tomika and Peterke\nwere squeezing my hand tightly, but my mother said, “Don’t\nyou want to sit down? We can walk. Come...    ”\nWe moved forward in a column of five rows. The bulbs of the searchlights\nblinded us in the eyes. A German officer, legs wide apart. He stood there\nsomewhere far away. Sent us to the right. Had to get undressed\nin a room. Then they sent us into another, and the iron door slammed,\nbolted shut. Screaming, I pounded on it again and again. We truly\nwere lost, as last I understood.... Turning around, the others\nalready shaved bald. I didn’t recognize anyone.\nThey stood there like sheep. Upon their skin, the writing of gooseflesh.",

    "text": "It was an adventure much could be made of: a walk\nOn the shores of the darkest known river,\nAmong the hooded, shoving crowds, by steaming rocks\nAnd rows of ruined huts half buried in the muck;\nThen to the great court with its marble yard\nWhose emptiness gave him the creeps, and to sit there\nIn the sunken silence of the place and speak\nOf what he had lost, what he still possessed of his loss,\nAnd, then, pulling out all the stops, describing her eyes,\nHer forehead where the golden light of evening spread,\nThe curve of her neck, the slope of her shoulders, everything\nDown to her thighs and calves, letting the words come,\nAs if lifted from sleep, to drift upstream,\nAgainst the water's will, where all the condemned\nAnd pointless labor, stunned by his voice's cadence,\nWould come to a halt, and even the crazed, disheveled\nFuries, for the first time, would weep, and the soot-filled\nAir would clear just enough for her, the lost bride,\nTo step through the image of herself and be seen in the light.\nAs everyone knows, this was the first great poem,\nWhich was followed by days of sitting around\nIn the houses of friends, with his head back, his eyes\nClosed, trying to will her return, but finding\nOnly himself, again and again, trapped\nIn the chill of his loss, and, finally,\nWithout a word, taking off to wander the hills\nOutside of town, where he stayed until he had shaken\nThe image of love and put in its place the world\nAs he wished it would be, urging its shape and measure\nInto speech of such newness that the world was swayed,\nAnd trees suddenly appeared in the bare place\nWhere he spoke and lifted their limbs and swept\nThe tender grass with the gowns of their shade,\nAnd stones, weightless for once, came and set themselves there,\nAnd small animals lay in the miraculous fields of grain\nAnd aisles of corn, and slept. The voice of light\nHad come forth from the body of fire, and each thing\nRose from its depths and shone as it never had.\nAnd that was the second great poem,\nWhich no one recalls anymore. The third and greatest\nCame into the world as the world, out of the unsayable,\nInvisible source of all longing to be; it came\nAs things come that will perish, to be seen or heard\nAwhile, like the coating of frost or the movement\nOf wind, and then no more; it came in the middle of sleep\nLike a door to the infinite, and, circled by flame,\nCame again at the moment of waking, and, sometimes,\nRemote and small, it came as a vision with trees\nBy a weaving stream, brushing the bank\nWith their violet shade, with somebody’s limbs\nScattered among the matted, mildewed leaves nearby,\nWith his severed head rolling under the waves,\nBreaking the shifting columns of light into a swirl\nOf slivers and flecks; it came in a language\nUntouched by pity, in lines, lavish and dark,\nWhere death is reborn and sent into the world as a gift,\nSo the future, with no voice of its own, nor hope\nOf ever becoming more than it will be, might mourn.",

I know not since that war began\nFrom which no people nobly stands aloof\nIf in all moments we have given proof\nOf virtues that were thought American.\nI know not if in all things done and said\nAll has been well and good,\nOr of each one of us can hold his head\nAs proudly as he should,\nOr, from the pattern of those mighty dead\nWhose shades our country venerates to-day,\nIf we 've not somewhat fallen and somewhat gone astray,\nBut you to whom our land's good name is dear,\nIf there be any here\nWho wonder if her manhood be decreased,\nRelaxed its sinews and its blood less red\nThan that at Shiloh and Antietam shed,\nBe proud of these, have joy in this at least,\nAnd cry: Now heaven be praised\nThat in that hour that most imperilled her,\nMenaced her liberty who foremost raised\nEurope's bright flag of freedom, some there were\nWho, not unmindful of the antique debt,\nCame back the generous path of Lafayette;\nAnd when of a most formidable foe\nShe checked each onset, arduous to stem—\nFoiled and frustrated them—\nOn those red fields where blow with furious blow\nWas countered, whether the gigantic fray\nRolled by the Meuse or at the Bois Sabot,\nAccents of ours were in the fierce mêlée;\nAnd on those furthest rims of hallowed ground\nWhere the forlorn, the gallant charge expires,\nWhen the slain bugler has long ceased to sound,\nAnd on the tangled wires\nThe last wild rally staggers, crumbles, stops,\nWithered beneath the shrapnel's iron showers:—\nNow heaven be thanked, we gave a few brave drops;\nNow heaven be thanked, a few brave drops were ours.'\n\nV\nThere, holding still, in frozen steadfastness,\nTheir bayonets toward the beckoning frontiers,\nThey lie—our comrades—lie among their peers,\nClad in the glory of fallen warriors,\nGrim clustered under thorny trellises,\nDry, furthest foam upon disastrous shores,\nLeaves that made last year beautiful, still strewn\nEven as they fell, unchanged, beneath the changing moon;\nAnd earth in her divine indifference\nRolls on, and many paltry things and mean\nPrate to be heard and caper to be seen.\nBut they are silent, clam; their eloquence\nIs that incomparable attitude;\nNo human presences their witness are,\nBut summer clouds and sunset crimson-hued,\nAnd showers and night winds and the northern star\nNay, even our salutations seem profane,\nOpposed to their Elysian quietude;\nOur salutations calling from afar,\nFrom our ignobler plane\nAnd undistinction of our lesser parts:\nHail, brothers, and farewell; you are twice blest, brave hearts.\nDouble your glory is who perished thus,\nFor you have died for France and vindicated us.",

No more was she.\nThe song and water were not medleyed sound\nEven if what she sang was what she heard,\nSince what she sang was uttered word by word.\nIt may be that in all her phrases stirred\nThe grinding water and the gasping wind;\nBut it was she and not the sea we heard.\n\nFor she was the maker of the song she sang.\nThe ever-hooded, tragic-gestured sea\nWas merely a place by which she walked to sing.\nWhose spirit is this? we said, because we knew\nIt was the spirit that we sought and knew\nThat we should ask this often as she sang.\n\nIf it was only the dark voice of the sea\nThat rose, or even colored by many waves;\nIf it was only the outer voice of sky\nAnd cloud, of the sunken coral water-walled,\nHowever clear, it would have been deep air,\nThe heaving speech of air, a summer sound\nRepeated in a summer without end\nAnd sound alone. But it was more than that,\nMore even than her voice, and ours, among\nThe meaningless plungings of water and the wind,\nTheatrical distances, bronze shadows heaped\nOn high horizons, mountainous atmospheres\nOf sky and sea.\n\nIt was her voice that made\nThe sky acutest at its vanishing.\nShe measured to the hour its solitude.\nShe was the single artificer of the world\nIn which she sang. And when she sang, the sea,\nWhatever self it had, became the self\nThat was her song, for she was the maker. Then we,\nAs we beheld her striding there alone,\nKnew that there never was a world for her\nExcept the one she sang and, singing, made.\n\nRamon Fernandez, tell me, if you know,\nWhy, when the singing ended and we turned\nToward the town, tell why the glassy lights,\nThe lights in the fishing boats at anchor there,\nAs the night descended, tilting in the air,\nMastered the night and portioned out the sea,\nFixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles,\nArranging, deepening, enchanting night.\n\nOh!

In the case of the two-term moniker,\npermit either/or — you may grab from the bag “Little.” In France,\nMarshall “Major” Taylor was le Nègre Volant—\nyou may grab from the bag “Flying.”\n\n•\n\n\nSometimes it’s a bad investment to self-publish\nautobiography —what a hoot. As in, pauperism\nmay wait for you with its long needles\nreadying to blow you out. Under the pauper’s empty ton\na man gets baby-bird gaping with hunger. The Major\nputs his wings inside and dies in Cook County Hospital\nwhere it’s too late. Hoot given, hoot held back. Ice-white nurses\ncome warm in their linens to fold back the wings beside\nthemselves, like any good cook come to shut a mouth.\n\nThis case of hoot has called for leg and wing and swoop.\nRise up, Major. Ghost-man old Birdie Munger’s bike\n— take back the front, it’s time to owl.",

A phantom shiner\nMight have swerved to snap up a three-tooth caddisfly,\nOr even Blackburn’s weevil, but it’s hard to tell\nWhy the white-winged sandpiper wheels\nAt the distant warble of a black-footed parakeet.\nGould’s emerald has a tiny, ferocious heart.\nDomed Mauritius tortoises are clannish,\nOften clashing with saddle-backed Mauritius tortoises,\nThough the saddle-backed Rodrigues tortoise\nEnjoys friendly relations with the domed Rodrigues tortoise.\nThe Santa Fe Island tortoise keeps to itself, brooding\nOver its sufferings.

The dodo is too trusting.\nThe laughing owl can be heard across the island.\nThe roar of the Caspian tiger resounds in a canyon.\nChildren shudder at the sound of the Bombay lion.\nBut not even the Caribbean monk seal\nHears the Caribbean monk seal mite silently make\nIts home in the manner of the passenger pigeon mite,\nBurrowing into the ear canal.\n\nThe warm river water\n\nThrough which the Durango shiner darts\nReflects a spectacled cormorant.

The sunlight\nBarely filters down to a Bodensee-kilch,\nBut a red-headed green macaw glimmers.\nThe Kona grosbeak filches fruit from volcanoes\nSloping down to the shore where Galápagos damsels\nFrolic and spawn. The bezoule makes a rare\nAppearance. Heath hens gather by the pond.\n\nOnly when the North Island giant moa starts to wonder\nAbout what happened to the South Island giant moa\nDoes the upland moa give any thought\nTo the whereabouts of the eastern moa. Meanwhile,\nThe coastal moa seems to have gone off\nAfter the heavy-footed moa, which follows\nIn its turn the tracks of the crested moa,\nWandering the islands looking for Mantell’s moa.\nNone of them have seen a bush moa in a while.\n\nEven as the quagga poses for its photograph,\nThe St. Croix racer is slithering out of the frame\nIn eager pursuit of a big-eared hopping mouse.\nThis may be the moment the Queen of Sheba’s gazelle\nTakes its leave, along with the Atlas bear,\nThe Palestinian painted frog, and several others.\nThe aurochs left long ago. The lapping waves\nEcho the strokes of the sea mink, but like\nThe Japanese river otter, it’s nowhere\nTo be seen. What will the confused moth do?\nThe same as Darwin’s rice rat.

I envy them.\nOnce I too could run\n\n\nover the asphalt, almost without knowing I inhabited a body\nwhose knees might seize up\n\nand swell. I will not run again in this life. Cirrus and cumulonimbus\n\nscud across the blue\n\nescutcheon of sky. Sun’s blazon through rain rampant, my life is a cloud study\nfor some larger landscape\n\n\nJohn Constable never got around to painting. It hangs in a gilded frame.\nPeople stare at it\n\nbefore passing on to more important canvases, to Renoir’s\n\nLes Parapluies, women\n\nand men opening shiny black umbrellas in a Paris park.\nThere a mother shelters\n\n\nher two daughters under an umbrella meant for one.\nThe younger daughter\n\nholds a wooden hoop she has been rolling along tamped dirt paths,\n\nwhipping it with a stick\n\nto keep it spinning, before the rain settled in. Renoir painted\nthis small family\n\n\nin his lush, impressionistic style. Five years later, after visiting\nItaly and studying\n\nPiero della Francesca’s frescoes, he came back and finished the painting\n\nin his new “manière aigre”\n\nor harsh style. He handled the gray silk folds of the auburn-haired woman’s dress\non the left as if they were\n\n\ngranite to be sculpted. She carries a market basket filled\nto the brim with shadow.\n\nTo approach old age, one needs a new, harsher style. Here, by the Liffey,\n\nmothers push screaming\n\ninfants in strollers. Five teenagers in blue jeans and bright yellow or green raincoats\nwalk by, joking, texting\n\n\non cell phones, smoking. One girl and her boy hang back, embrace, French-kiss\na long ten seconds.\n\nAnother boy shouts over his shoulder, “Get a room!” A pair\n\nof mute swans\n\npreens and swims down the River Liffey, whose amber waters mirror\nhow the clouds pass,\n\n\navalanche of cumulus that hangs forever on the burnished\nunrippling surface\n\nof my memory — vast sky surf, cloud after cloud cresting, breaking\n\nto be washed\n\naway to blue nothing. Each of us — lovers, mothers, runners, me — no more\nthan windblown swansdown.",

When you are a Hartford insurance executive, as Wallace Stevens was, and you have never been to Oklahoma, as he had not, you can invent people to dance there, as he did, and you can name them Bonnie and Josie. But a THERE depends on how, in the beginning, the wind breathes upon its surface. Shh: amethyst, sapphire. Lead. Crystal mirror. See, a cow-pond in Oklahoma. Under willows now, so the Osage man fishing there is in the shade. A bobwhite whistles from his fencepost, a hundred yards south of the pond. A muskrat-head draws a nest of Vs up to the pond’s apex, loses them there in the reeds and sedges where a redwing blackbird, with gold and scarlet epaulets flashing, perches on the jiggly buttonwood branch. Purple martins skim the pond, dip and sip, veer and swoop, check, pounce, crisscross each other’s flashing paths. His wife in the Indian Hospital with cancer. Children in various unhappiness. White clouds sail slowly across the pure blue pond. Turtles poke their heads up, watch the Indian man casting, reeling, casting, reeling. A bass strikes, is hooked, fights, is reeled in, pulls away again, is drawn back, dragged ashore, put on the stringer. In Oklahoma, Wally, here is Josie’s father. Something that is going to be nothing, but isn’t. Watch: now he takes the bass home, cleans and fries it. Shall I tell you a secret, Gert? You have to be there before it’s there.

The worshippers swayed like trees in the wind. Master Hirano and the priest from the Kegon sect stood there, bald and wrapped in robes, behind the congregation, and the beadle whispered into our ears:Are they Jews? Are they Jews?\nWhen we left the synagogue Master Hirano said to the priest from the Kegon sect: There is no doubt that they understand what devotion (he said shujaku) is. The priest from the Kegon sect said: There is no doubt. They know what devotion is.\nOn Jerusalem Street, by the monument of the mortar, commemorating the ’48 war, Master Hirano said: Prayer is a good thing. The priest from the Kegon sect said: There is no doubt. Prayer is a good thing.\nMaster Hirano stood on one side of the mortar and the priest from the Kegon sect stood on the other and the moon rose, big and full, yellow like the fields painted by Van Gogh.\n\n* * *\n\nIt’s possible to write only by means of non-writing. When things come from the opposite direction.\nMy aunt Edith rises out of the ground and returns to her bed in the nursing home. Ursula, my stepmother, is walking backward. All sorts of wilted flowers bring their petals toward themselves.\nAll we need is yogurt and a spoon. We’ll know what to do with the spoon. We’ll lead it toward the right place (which is to say, the yogurt) and from there toward the mouth. But the mouth can’t be fathomed. Likewise the word that stands for it (mouth) is strange in the extreme.\nOr take, for example, the hand that’s holding the spoon with its five tragic fingers. There’s no logic whatsoever in there being five. Like five widows who’ve gathered because their husbands have died, and they allow themselves this movement through the air in order to keep from losing their minds.\n\nThere is no limit to the beauty of things that are sad. Like old clay vases or a wagon’s shaft in a junkyard. Every year the plum trees flower anew, and people whose names are Shtiasni or Dahaan open doors and close them.\nAll these things fill the heart with great joy. The beauty of death and the violet colors accompanying it. Announcements that make nothing dawn on one, and the dawn itself rising from nowhere like a birthday present 365 days a year.",

Ripe was the drowsy hour;\nThe blissful cloud of summer-indolence\nBenumb’d my eyes; my pulse grew less and less;\nPain had no sting, and pleasure’s wreath no flower:\nO, why did ye not melt, and leave my sense\nUnhaunted quite of all but—nothingness?\n\nA third time pass’d they by, and, passing, turn’d\nEach one the face a moment whiles to me;\nThen faded, and to follow them I burn’d\nAnd ached for wings, because I knew the three;\nThe first was a fair Maid, and Love her name;\nThe second was Ambition, pale of cheek,\nAnd ever watchful with fatiguèd eye;\nThe last, whom I love more, the more of blame\nIs heap’d upon her, maiden most unmeek,—\nI knew to be my demon Poesy.\n\nThey faded, and, forsooth! I wanted wings:\nO folly! What is Love? and where is it?\nAnd for that poor Ambition! it springs\nFrom a man’s little heart’s short fever-fit;\nFor Poesy!—no,—she has not a joy,—\nAt least for me,—so sweet as drowsy noons,\nAnd evenings steep’d in honey’d indolence;\nO, for an age so shelter’d from annoy,\nThat I may never know how change the moons,\nOr hear the voice of busy common-sense!\n\nAnd once more came they by:—alas! wherefore?\nMy sleep had been embroider’d with dim dreams;\nMy soul had been a lawn besprinkled o’er\nWith flowers, and stirring shades, and baffled beams:\nThe morn was clouded, but no shower fell,\nTho’ in her lids hung the sweet tears of May;\nThe open casement press’d a new-leaved vine,\nLet in the budding warmth and throstle’s lay;\nO Shadows! ’twas a time to bid farewell!\nUpon your skirts had fallen no tears of mine.\n\nSo, ye three Ghosts, adieu! Ye cannot raise\nMy head cool-bedded in the flowery grass;\nFor I would not be dieted with praise,\nA pet-lamb in a sentimental farce!\nFade softly from my eyes, and be once more\nIn masque-like figures on the dreamy urn;\nFarewell! I yet have visions for the night,\nAnd for the day faint visions there is store;\nVanish, ye Phantoms! from my idle spright,\nInto the clouds, and never more return!",

    "text": "Out here on Cottage Grove it matters. The galloping\nWind balks at its shadow. The carriages\nAre drawn forward under a sky of fumed oak.\nThis is America calling:\nThe mirroring of state to state,\nOf voice to voice on the wires,\nThe force of colloquial greetings like golden\nPollen sinking on the afternoon breeze.\nIn service stairs the sweet corruption thrives;\nThe page of dusk turns like a creaking revolving stage in Warren, Ohio.\n\nIf this is the way it is let’s leave,\nThey agree, and soon the slow boxcar journey begins,\nGradually accelerating until the gyrating fans of suburbs\nEnfolding the darkness of cities are remembered\nOnly as a recurring tic. And midway\nWe meet the disappointed, returning ones, without its\nBeing able to stop us in the headlong night\nToward the nothing of the coast. At Bolinas\nThe houses doze and seem to wonder why through the\nPacific haze, and the dreams alternately glow and grow dull.\nWhy be hanging on here? Like kites, circling,\nSlipping on a ramp of air, but always circling?\n\nBut the variable cloudiness is pouring it on,\nFlooding back to you like the meaning of a joke.\nThe land wasn’t immediately appealing; we built it\nPartly over with fake ruins, in the image of ourselves:\nAn arch that terminates in mid-keystone, a crumbling stone pier\nFor laundresses, an open-air theater, never completed\nAnd only partially designed. How are we to inhabit\nThis space from which the fourth wall is invariably missing,\nAs in a stage-set or dollhouse, except by staying as we are,\nIn lost profile, facing the stars, with dozens of as yet\nUnrealized projects, and a strict sense\nOf time running out, of evening presenting\nThe tactfully folded-over bill? And we fit\nRather too easily into it, become transparent,\nAlmost ghosts. One day\nThe birds and animals in the pasture have absorbed\nThe color, the density of the surroundings,\nThe leaves are alive, and too heavy with life.\n\nA long period of adjustment followed.\nIn the cities at the turn of the century they knew about it\nBut were careful not to let on as the iceman and the milkman\nDisappeared down the block and the postman shouted\nHis daily rounds. The children under the trees knew it\nBut all the fathers returning home\nOn streetcars after a satisfying day at the office undid it:\nThe climate was still floral and all the wallpaper\nIn a million homes all over the land conspired to hide it.\nOne day we thought of painted furniture, of how\nIt just slightly changes everything in the room\nAnd in the yard outside, and how, if we were going\nTo be able to write the history of our time, starting with today,\nIt would be necessary to model all these unimportant details\nSo as to be able to include them; otherwise the narrative\nWould have that flat, sandpapered look the sky gets\nOut in the middle west toward the end of summer,\nThe look of wanting to back out before the argument\nHas been resolved, and at the same time to save appearances\nSo that tomorrow will be pure. Therefore, since we have to do our business\nIn spite of things, why not make it in spite of everything?\nThat way, maybe the feeble lakes and swamps\nOf the back country will get plugged into the circuit\nAnd not just the major events but the whole incredible\nMass of everything happening simultaneously and pairing off,\nChanneling itself into history, will unroll\nAs carefully and as casually as a conversation in the next room,\nAnd the purity of today will invest us like a breeze,\nOnly be hard, spare, ironical: something one can\nTip one’s hat to and still get some use out of.\n\nThe parade is turning into our street.\nMy stars, the burnished uniforms and prismatic\nFeatures of this instant belong here. The land\nIs pulling away from the magic, glittering coastal towns\nTo an aforementioned rendezvous with August and December.\nThe hunch is it will always be this way,\nThe look, the way things first scared you\nIn the night light, and later turned out to be,\nYet still capable, all the same, of a narrow fidelity\nTo what you and they wanted to become:\nNo sighs like Russian music, only a vast unravelling\nOut toward the junctions and to the darkness beyond\nTo these bare fields, built at today’s expense.",

Is it noble, then,\nTo break God's laws only by killing men\nTo save one's country from destruction?\nWe took no man's life but gave our chastity,\nAnd sinned the ancient sin\nTo plant young trees and fill felled forests in.\n\nOh, clergy of the land,\nBible in hand,\nAll reverently you stand,\nOn holy thoughts intent\nWhile barren wives receive the sacrament!\nHad you the open visions you could see\nPhantoms of infants murdered in the womb,\nWho never knew a cradle or a tomb,\nHovering about these wives accusingly.\n\nBestow the sacrament!

Whirl! Centripetal! Mate!\nWhat is the use of talking, until I end my song,\nI end my song in the dark.\nI call in the nurse,\nHold the pill in my hand\nAs she says, “Take this,”\nAnd swallow it down, silent.",

I was ten, small as the flame\nOf a struck match, my lungs fiery\nFrom hard, wintery play. When I returned home,\nLegs hurting, I placed my hands on the windowsill\nAnd looked out—clouds dirty as towels\nAnd geese I have yet to see again\nDarkening the western sky.\n\nMonsignor, a machine\nHad painted on the eyes of my toy soldier,\nLittle dots off-center,\nAlmost on his cheeks. Such a cheap toy,\nI drowned him over and over in my bath,\nDrowned him until the painted-on eyes flaked off.\nThen a leg fell off—surge of dirty water\nSunk him to the bottom.\n\nI now at this age place hands on the windowsill,\nMy eyes nearly on my cheeks,\nMy belly with its rising tide.\nThere is no angel with an orange at the edge\nOf my bed. There is no soldier\nOf God. Only a pane between the inside\nAnd the outside, between this living\nAnd this dying. Monsignor,\nSaintly man of this child's wonderment,\nWhen will I see the geese again?",

Coldly afflicted,\nMy feet were by frost benumbed.\nChill its chains are; chafing sighs\nHew my heart round and hunger begot\nMere-weary mood. Lest man know not\nThat he on dry land loveliest liveth,\nList how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea,\nWeathered the winter, wretched outcast\nDeprived of my kinsmen;\nHung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,\nThere I heard naught save the harsh sea\nAnd ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries,\nDid for my games the gannet's clamour,\nSea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter,\nThe mews' singing all my mead-drink.\nStorms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern\nIn icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed\nWith spray on his pinion.\nNot any protector\nMay make merry man faring needy.\nThis he little believes, who aye in winsome life\nAbides 'mid burghers some heavy business,\nWealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft\nMust bide above brine.\nNeareth nightshade, snoweth from north,\nFrost froze the land, hail fell on earth then\nCorn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now\nThe heart's thought that I on high streams\nThe salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.\nMoaneth alway my mind's lust\nThat I fare forth, that I afar hence\nSeek out a foreign fastness.\nFor this there's no mood-lofty man over earth's midst,\nNot though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed;\nNor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful\nBut shall have his sorrow for sea-fare\nWhatever his lord will.\nHe hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having\nNor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight\nNor any whit else save the wave's slash,\nYet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.\nBosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries,\nFields to fairness, land fares brisker,\nAll this admonisheth man eager of mood,\nThe heart turns to travel so that he then thinks\nOn flood-ways to be far departing.\nCuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,\nHe singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,\nThe bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not —\nHe the prosperous man — what some perform\nWhere wandering them widest draweth.\nSo that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock,\nMy mood 'mid the mere-flood,\nOver the whale's acre, would wander wide.\nOn earth's shelter cometh oft to me,\nEager and ready, the crying lone-flyer,\nWhets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly,\nO'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow\nMy lord deems to me this dead life\nOn loan and on land, I believe not\nThat any earth-weal eternal standeth\nSave there be somewhat calamitous\nThat, ere a man's tide go, turn it to twain.\nDisease or oldness or sword-hate\nBeats out the breath from doom-gripped body.\nAnd for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after —\nLaud of the living, boasteth some last word,\nThat he will work ere he pass onward,\nFrame on the fair earth 'gainst foes his malice,\nDaring ado, ...\nSo that all men shall honour him after\nAnd his laud beyond them remain 'mid the English,\nAye, for ever, a lasting life's-blast,\nDelight mid the doughty.\nDays little durable,\nAnd all arrogance of earthen riches,\nThere come now no kings nor Cæsars\nNor gold-giving lords like those gone.\nHowe'er in mirth most magnified,\nWhoe'er lived in life most lordliest,\nDrear all this excellence, delights undurable!\nWaneth the watch, but the world holdeth.\nTomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low.\nEarthly glory ageth and seareth.\nNo man at all going the earth's gait,\nBut age fares against him, his face paleth,\nGrey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions,\nLordly men are to earth o'ergiven,\nNor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth,\nNor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry,\nNor stir hand nor think in mid heart,\nAnd though he strew the grave with gold,\nHis born brothers, their buried bodies\nBe an unlikely treasure hoard.",

Around him the other petty thieves,\n\nWith arms outstretched, &amp; eyes pecked out by birds, reclined,\nFastened forever to scaffolds which gradually would cover\nAn Empire’s hills &amp; line its roads as far\nAs anyone escaping in a cart could see, his swerving mind\n\nOn the dark brimming up in everything, the reins\nGoing slack in his hand as the cart slows, &amp; stops,\nAnd the horse sees its own breath go out\nOnto the cold air, &amp; gazes after the off-white plume,\n\nAnd seems amazed by it, by its breath, by everything.\nBut the man slumped behind it, dangling a lost nail\nBetween his lips, only stares at the swishing tail,\nAt each white breath going out, thinning, &amp; then vanishing,\n\nFor he has grown tired of amazing things.",

Vis-\nitors   enter  barefooted,  leaving   behind  the  dung,  dried frogs, spilled\npetrol  and  ketchup  traces  of  the  streets.  Hundreds  of  pairs  of  gold\nand  silver  sandals wait  here  for  the  women  who will re-emerge from\nthe  vigil  with  the  taste of  basil  leaf and sugar in  their deep-breathing\nmouths  and  carpet  fibres between  their  toes.   The  sandals,  gold  and\nsilver,  seem all alike.  How  can the women tell them apart? They do tell\nthem apart. It  is  as if  each  pair  sings an  intimate mantra to its  owner,\naudible  only to  her. One day I too shall return to expectant slippers that\nstack  up  like the  moon  and  the  stars  outside a  marble  building;  one\nday I shall not have to wear child's shoes.\n\nSUNDAY BEFORE SCHOOL: WHITE SNEAKERS\n\nSeven  years  of these shoes are a chemical memory.  The Convent ruled\nthat  pupils' shoes  must  be white: absolutely white.  Who  can  imagine\na  1980s  shoe  that  was  absolutely  white,  without  any  logo,  with  no\nswoosh,  not  a  single slogan?  Sunday evenings, before the school week,\nI  crouched  down  on  the  pink  bathroom  tiles  and  painted  my  shoes\ninto  the  absolute  of  whiteness;  like  the  Alice  in Wonderland garden-\ners  repainting  roses.  This  task  was  performed  with a  toothbrush and\nwith  special  paste that annihilated so many design features.  Purity was\nattained  by  the application  of  a whitener  that  stank  of scientific poly-\nsyllables.  Convent-girl  identity.  Tabula rasa.  Toxicity  and intoxication:\nwith  good  intentions,  getting  high on paste.\n\nBAD MARRIAGE SHOES: SILVER BALLET SLIPPERS\n\nWhen I met my ex, I was  already  committed to heels: black ankle  boots \nwith  four-inch  stacks for  walking through snow;  French  cream curved\nsuede  stilettos for scaling fire-escape  ladders  on to  rooftops  to  admire\nthe  winter  sky;  even after I  left him,  scarlet satin  bedroom-only  spiky\nmules  to  amuse myself.  Early  on, my ex  said that the way women walk\nin  heels  looks ugly.  And my  nails  made  unnatural  social appearances:\nemerald  lacquer;  cobalt;  incarnadine. Sign of a  bad  marriage:  I  began\nto  wear  flats. The penitential  mermaid shoes,  worn once and once only,\nwere  a Gabor creation: distressed  silver  ballet  slippers  with netted and\ncriss-cross side  details  which  would  make  the material  seem  to  swish\nwith  the changes  of  light on feet that go walking.  Cool  as  moonlight on\na  tourist  coastline. But the  inner  stitching  hooked  the  softness  of  my\nskin, which  has  always  been  too  soft;  but  I could not turn back, for we\nhad  tickets  to an evening  of  Mozart;  but the paper tissues that I stuffed\ninto  my  shoes  failed to act as  a  protective   lining.   Paper  tissue  snow-\nflecks  teardropped  with crimson  blood created  a  trail  behind  me  as  I\nascended  the  many  tiers  of  the  wedding-cake concert hall.\n\nBAREFOOT: PEARL PINK POLISH\n\nSitting  next  to someone  can  make  my  feet  curl:  shy,  self-destructive\nand  oyster-like, they want to  shuck  their cases,  to  present  themselves,\nlittle undersea pinks; their skin  still  is  too  soft, their  toes still too long,\ntheir  ankles still too slender, for a modern fit. But he  is not modern;  he\nsits like stone, and my bare feet are cool, they will not have to bleed.",

You will probably have the second illusion\nThat no one likes you, which doesn’t jibe with the first illusion\nOf no other people. This was about the extent of it, for the Spanish,\nThey felt all that just a few hours a week, but every week at home,\nLiving in, say, small San Francisco,\nWhich made thinking slow and hard at these times,\nBut if you try this yourself in the deep woods\nYou’ll see you can still think enough\nAnd you’ll remember your way back to the loving arms\nOf your wife, husband, or mother, in Rochester. (Yes,\nYou could try it as a child, but please don’t.)\nThe Spanish had a purpose to walk east inland to the Sierras, the gold.\nThe Indians said there were five hills and two mountains\nEntirely of gold and you had to wear ferns dangling before your eyes\nLike sunglasses when you got near the mountains.\nThe hills, they said, were not so bright.\nThe Spanish thought this was bullshit\nBut were having trouble with the coast (where\nThey truly believed the gold was) which was that boats\nCould not travel north and south even as fast as people walking\nBecause the Pacific coast was opposing currents (you made\nHalf a mile an hour in the water with biggest sail).\nAn expedition of thirty Spaniards from Spain (living\nIn small San Francisco) walked east inland toward what’s now Mariposa.\nIt means butterfly. In that place, the shivering feathery\nInsects rose from the ground and blacked out the sun.\nThe sky had no room for more butterflies so the leftovers attached to the trees,\nMaking the trees appear like ragged trees.\nLook up the other way, the explorers said to each other, but\nThat way, when they did, was no blue sky but darkness of orange insects\nThat did not fly in clouds but were the sky,\nSo any forward motion by the thirty men seemed, not seemed\nDid make the sky covered each inch\nWith the thin trembling insects, brown or green or orange,\nBut as a whole a black ceiling with little light between them and the men,\nWho thought slow and hard but did think, and so returned\nTo small San Francisco where no one believed them but understood\nThe illusion because when they asked the thirty men\nWhat such an encounter with butterflies felt like, the men described\nFeeling the way all the colonists and explorers and priests and women\nFelt a few hours each week at home—\nFear making the olfactory illusion of burning rye toast hand\nIn hand with the illusion of being the only one\nAnd the simultaneous but contradictory illusion\nThat no one likes you. How could everybody hate you\nIf there was no everybody? Or even anybody.\nWell there was a way to fix this\nAnd we use it now around here (I\nMean in New York and California and Nevada and Hawaii,\nNot just in my house) which is to wrap our loving arms\nAround each other. It works very well\nAnd I know you’ve tried it.\nThe Spanish from Spain brought virtuous women\nOver for that purpose only (you don’t think the virtuous babes looked\nFor gold, did you?) and it worked very well\nExcept the women were worse, I mean much worse,\nNot just specially a little insane and needed\nThe loving arms much more than the men.\nThey needed longer sessions and more sessions.\nWhat’s more, if the expedition of thirty butterfly\nIllusionists had gone six miles further,\nThey would have seen silver sticking out of the ground\nLike glass after a four-car accident on a street in Rochester.\nBut for many decades the promise of the waiting loving arms,\nVersus the unacceptable illusion of the butterflies\nForming the entire black sky, kept them near the coasts.\nWhen you put down this book, you could decide\nFor yourself if it is true that wrapping loving arms around\nSomebody is as temporarily powerful as I’ve made it\nOut to be or is possibly permanently powerful or is an illusion\nLike the massed feathery insects which were absolute.",

This,\nso sons and daughters might step off\ninto another era, choose instruments of wood and metal,\naxes of their own timbre.\n\nThis so Jimmy might mix his own palette—\ntune each turquoise pitch and purple tone\ninto an electric blues old as corridos,\nbut new to the mexicanos who came each\nSunday to the market at Maxwell.\n\nNew to the ears of Roberto, a boy, who would keep\nhis ranchera rhythms close\nas a pair of old jeans but grow\ninto the blues as he listened\nto the heirs of Papa Jackson—\nJohnny Young, Howlin’ Wolf, Nighthawk\nand Maxwell Jimmy.

How\nto take Jimmy back in time to the market\nwhose merchants once hustled\nwith tricks for trade ancient as Africa, as Toltec Mexico,\nMaxwell, whose live blues bands\nand car radios belting norteño mixes made\nevery Sunday a session.\n\nHow to take Jimmy back\nto Maxwell’s gathering spot where he guzzles\nfrom an aluminum garden blooming atop his amp,\nswings his ax—\nfingers climbing its trunk, plucking twigs—\nwhile our feet tap the roots\nof this wailing tree. Notes skip through alleys\nof his voice like gravel\npinging off windshields, lift a pitch\nhigh enough to singe the autumn sky—\ncousin to the red and green gritos of the barrio\nonly blocks away. Twelve bars spin\nlike metal rims, stack like hubcaps,\nchords crackling in the tin barrels of his laughter.\nWhen the people gather, he sputters,\nWhat did the one-eyed woman say?\nand waits for them to peer into the devil’s draw\nof his eyes before he roars,\nWhere is my one-eyed man?\n\nBut we barely get to the punch line, to the end\nof a set, before the mayor swings his ax,\na claw that rips this árbol de blues up by its roots;\nbefore Chicago swings its wrecking ball\nto level homes, stores, restaurants, bars;\nbefore troops graffiti-blast, scrub and cinch-sack it\nall, but one empty wall\nwhere someone has scrawled Jimmy’s name\namong the others in this hall of fame:\nWillie, Hound Dog, Honey Boy, Sal,\nthe many legends who’ve shared the marrow\nof their music, of Santana’s hearty\nsoup with the bones still in it steaming with sabor\nand sometimes weeping.",

    "text": "Besides Sundays there were Wednesday evenings and the occasional Tuesday. They called Tuesdays “visitation” and we would meet in the parking lot and load into a van. There were little cards with peoples’ names and addresses on them and we’d drive around until contact was made. I always managed to hide a few cards and claimed carsickness but it was too humid to stay in the van. Oftentimes I’d recognize someone from school and felt like apologizing but couldn’t. On Wednesdays, it was a bit easier because we arrived early so my mom could volunteer. I skated the parking curbs on the side of the building and could hear the choir practice. Other times I’d wait on the stairs at the cosmetology school next door. There was this kid who dropped out of eighth grade, and I was his lookout while he smoked. He preferred to be called Fluid and got kicked out of youth group more than once. The youth minister was large and pale and wore tight shirts that made sweat stains around his belly. One day we went on a retreat that turned out to be a rented trailer in the country. In the afternoon we watched films inside and at night played games in the dark. I wound up sleeping under a table listening to Sanitarium from Master of Puppets on repeat. The following morning my headphones were taken away so I could be open to the message. Other retreats included all night bowling and Friday night lock-up. Arrival was at ten and they would keep us awake with caffeine, sweets, and more games. I frequently got nervous being separated into groups and remember once winning a race in the foyer wearing high-heels. Later I escaped to the pews of the sanctuary. It was pitch black and I found myself standing in a drained baptismal with white robes hanging over the windows. It was strange to see where all those people went after the altar calls. Those were on Sunday mornings and the services were very long and formal. It was important to sit behind the older ladies so you could sleep behind their hair. After the closing song I’d wait in the car seemingly for hours, listening to mix tapes, mostly Suicidal Tendencies or Maiden. Then we’d drive to a Chinese restaurant or go to this pizza place that had a buffet. I’d watch the others play video games but most of the time I’d just go outside. The clouds were always cumulus and some afternoons you could hear the wind and think about what it’d be like to be somewhere else. It really didn’t matter though, maybe I could get dropped off at a friend’s, watch Kung-Fu Theater, or skate the mini-ramp in the backyard. He had twin sisters and we could do whatever we wanted.",

    "text": "The rain, in the backyard where I watch it fall, comes down at different  rates. In the center a fine discontinuous curtain — or network — falls implacably and yet gently in drops that are probably quite light; a strengthless sempiternal precipitation, an intense fraction of the atmosphere at its purest. A little distance from the walls to the right and left plunk heavier drops, one by one. Here they seem about the size of grains of wheat, the size of a pea, while elsewhere they are big as marbles. Along gutters and window frames the rain runs horizontally, while depending from the same obstacles it hangs like individually wrapped candies. Along the entire surface of a little zinc roof under my eyes it trickles in a very thin sheet, a moiré pattern formed by the varying currents created by the imperceptible bumps and undulations of the surface. From the gutter it flows with the restraint of a shallow creek until it tumbles out into a perfectly vertical net, rather imperfectly braided, all the way to the ground where it breaks and sparkles into brilliant needles.\n\nEach of its forms has its particular allure and corresponds to a particular patter. Together they share the intensity of a complex mechanism  as precise as it is dangerous, like a steam-powered clock whose spring is wound by the force of the precipitation.\n\nThe ringing on the ground of the vertical trickles, the glug-glug of the gutters, the miniscule strikes of the gong multiply and resonate all at once in a concert without monotony, and not without a certain delicacy.\n\nOnce the spring unwinds itself certain wheels go on turning for a while, more and more slowly, until the whole mechanism comes to a stop. It all vanishes with the sun: when it finally reappears, the brilliant apparatus evaporates. It has rained.\nTranslated from the French",

The darkness. Drawn\nDarkness, or dirty light. The soil that stirs.\nThe soil that looks the soil of centuries.\nAnd for that matter the general oldness. Old\nWood. Old marble. Old tile. Old old old.\nNot homekind Oldness!

In this, this “flat,”\nTheir hostess is gathering up the oozed, the rich\nRugs of the morning (tattered! the bespattered. . . .)\nReadies to spread clean rugs for afternoon.\nHere is a scene for you. The Ladies look,\nIn horror, behind a substantial citizeness\nWhose trains clank out across her swollen heart.\nWho, arms akimbo, almost fills a door.\nAll tumbling children, quilts dragged to the floor\nAnd tortured thereover, potato peelings, soft-\nEyed kitten, hunched-up, haggard, to-be-hurt.\nTheir League is allotting largesse to the Lost.\nBut to put their clean, their pretty money, to put\nTheir money collected from delicate rose-fingers\nTipped with their hundred flawless rose-nails seems . . .\nThey own Spode, Lowestoft, candelabra,\nMantels, and hostess gowns, and sunburst clocks,\nTurtle soup, Chippendale, red satin “hangings,”\nAubussons and Hattie Carnegie. They Winter\nIn Palm Beach; cross the Water in June; attend,\nWhen suitable, the nice Art Institute;\nBuy the right books in the best bindings; saunter\nOn Michigan, Easter mornings, in sun or wind.\nOh Squalor! This sick four-story hulk, this fibre\nWith fissures everywhere! Why, what are bringings\nOf loathe-love largesse? What shall peril hungers\nSo old old, what shall flatter the desolate?\nTin can, blocked fire escape and chitterling\nAnd swaggering seeking youth and the puzzled wreckage\nOf the middle passage, and urine and stale shames\nAnd, again, the porridges of the underslung\nAnd children children children. Heavens! That\nWas a rat, surely, off there, in the shadows? Long\nAnd long-tailed? Gray? The Ladies from the Ladies’\nBetterment League agree it will be better\nTo achieve the outer air that rights and steadies,\nTo hie to a house that does not holler, to ring\nBells elsetime, better presently to cater\nTo no more Possibilities, to get\nAway. Perhaps the money can be posted.\nPerhaps they two may choose another Slum!\nSome serious sooty half-unhappy home!—\nWhere loathe-love likelier may be invested.\nKeeping their scented bodies in the center\nOf the hall as they walk down the hysterical hall,\nThey allow their lovely skirts to graze no wall,\nAre off at what they manage of a canter,\nAnd, resuming all the clues of what they were,\nTry to avoid inhaling the laden air.",

    "text": "Your dying was a difficult enterprise.\nFirst, petty things took up your energies,\nThe small but clustering duties of the sick,\nIrritant as the cough’s dry rhetoric.\nThose hours of waiting for pills, shot, X-ray\nOr test (while you read novels two a day)\nAlready with a kind of clumsy stealth\nDistanced you from the habits of your health.\nIn hope still, courteous still, but tired and thin,\nYou tried to stay the man that you had been,\nTreating each symptom as a mere mishap\nWithout import. But then the spinal tap.\nIt brought a hard headache, and when night came\nI heard you wake up from the same bad dream\nEvery half-hour with the same short cry\nOf mild outrage, before immediately\nSlipping into the nightmare once again\nEmpty of content but the drip of pain.\nNo respite followed: though the nightmare ceased,\nYour cough grew thick and rich, its strength increased.\nFour nights, and on the fifth we drove you down\nTo the Emergency Room. That frown, that frown:\nI’d never seen such rage in you before\nAs when they wheeled you through the swinging door.\nFor you knew, rightly, they conveyed you from\nThose normal pleasures of the sun’s kingdom\nThe hedonistic body basks within\nAnd takes for granted—summer on the skin,\nSleep without break, the moderate taste of tea\nIn a dry mouth. You had gone on from me\nAs if your body sought out martyrdom\nIn the far Canada of a hospital room.\nOnce there, you entered fully the distress\nAnd long pale rigours of the wilderness.\nA gust of morphine hid you. Back in sight\nYou breathed through a segmented tube, fat, white,\nJammed down your throat so that you could not speak.\nHow thin the distance made you. In your cheek\nOne day, appeared the true shape of your bone\nNo longer padded. Still your mind, alone,\nExplored this emptying intermediate\nState for what holds and rests were hidden in it.\nYou wrote us messages on a pad, amused\nAt one time that you had your nurse confused\nWho, seeing you reconciled after four years\nWith your grey father, both of you in tears,\nAsked if this was at last your ‘special friend’\n(The one you waited for until the end).\n‘She sings,’ you wrote, ‘a Philippine folk song\nTo wake me in the morning ... It is long\nAnd very pretty.’ Grabbing at detail\nTo furnish this bare ledge toured by the gale,\nOn which you lay, bed restful as a knife,\nYou tried, tried hard, to make of it a life\nThick with the complicating circumstance\nYour thoughts might fasten on. It had been chance\nAlways till now that had filled up the moment\nWith live specifics your hilarious comment\nDiscovered as it went along; and fed,\nLaconic, quick, wherever it was led.\nYou improvised upon your own delight.\nI think back to the scented summer night\nWe talked between our sleeping bags, below\nA molten field of stars five years ago:\nI was so tickled by your mind’s light touch\nI couldn’t sleep, you made me laugh too much,\nThough I was tired and begged you to leave off.\n\nNow you were tired, and yet not tired enough\n—Still hungry for the great world you were losing\nSteadily in no season of your choosing—\nAnd when at last the whole death was assured,\nDrugs having failed, and when you had endured\nTwo weeks of an abominable constraint,\nYou faced it equably, without complaint,\nUnwhimpering, but not at peace with it.\nYou’d lived as if your time was infinite:\nYou were not ready and not reconciled,\nFeeling as uncompleted as a child\nTill you had shown the world what you could do\nIn some ambitious role to be worked through,\nA role your need for it had half-defined,\nBut never wholly, even in your mind.\nYou lacked the necessary ruthlessness,\nThe soaring meanness that pinpoints success.\nWe loved that lack of self-love, and your smile,\nRueful, at your own silliness.\nMeanwhile,\nYour lungs collapsed, and the machine, unstrained,\nDid all your breathing now. Nothing remained\nBut death by drowning on an inland sea\nOf your own fluids, which it seemed could be\nKindly forestalled by drugs. Both could and would:\nNothing was said, everything understood,\nAt least by us. Your own concerns were not\nLong-term, precisely, when they gave the shot\n—You made local arrangements to the bed\nAnd pulled a pillow round beside your head.\nAnd so you slept, and died, your skin gone grey,\nAchieving your completeness, in a way.\n\nOutdoors next day, I was dizzy from a sense\nOf being ejected with some violence\nFrom vigil in a white and distant spot\nWhere I was numb, into this garden plot\nToo warm, too close, and not enough like pain.\nI was delivered into time again\n—The variations that I live among\nWhere your long body too used to belong\nAnd where the still bush is minutely active.\nYou never thought your body was attractive,\nThough others did, and yet you trusted it\nAnd must have loved its fickleness a bit\nSince it was yours and gave you what it could,\nTill near the end it let you down for good,\nIts blood hospitable to those guests who\nTook over by betraying it into\nThe greatest of its inconsistencies\nThis difficult, tedious, painful enterprise.",

I prayed: If she must die,\nlet it only be some dream. But there were times, Mother,\nwhile you slept, that I prayed, \"Saints, let her die.\"\nNot, I swear by you, that I wished you to die\nbut to save you as you were, young, in song in Kashmir,\nand I, one festival, crowned Krishna by you, Kashmir\nlistening to my flute.

Windows open on Kashmir:\nThere, the fragile wood-shrines—so far away—of Kashmir!\nO Destroyer, let her return there, if just to die.\nSave the right she gave its earth to cover her, Kashmir\nhas no rights. When the windows close on Kashmir,\nI see the blizzard-fall of ghost-elephants.\nI hold back—she couldn’t bear it—one elephant’s\nstory: his return (in a country far from Kashmir)\nto the jungle where each year, on the day his mother\ndied, he touches with his trunk the bones of his mother.\n\n\"As you sit here by me, you’re just like my mother,\"\nshe tells me. I imagine her: a bride in Kashmir,\nshe’s watching, at the Regal, her first film with Father.\nIf only I could gather you in my arms, Mother,\nI’d save you—now my daughter—from God. The universe\nopens its ledger. I write: How helpless was God’s mother!\nEach page is turned to enter grief’s accounts. Mother,\nI see a hand.Tell me it’s not God’s. Let it die.\nI see it. It’s filling with diamonds. Please let it die.\nAre you somewhere alive, somewhere alive, Mother?\nDo you hear what I once held back: in one elephant’s\ncry, by his mother’s bones, the cries of those elephants\n\nthat stunned the abyss? Ivory blots out the elephants.\nI enter this:The Beloved leaves one behind to die.\nFor compared to my grief for you, what are those of Kashmir,\nand what (I close the ledger) are the griefs of the universe\nwhen I remember you—beyond all accounting—O my mother?",

    "text": "The children are eating lunch at home on a summer weekday when a man comes to the door and asks their mother if she has anything that needs fixing or carrying or any yardwork he can do. They chew their food a little dreamily as, with her back straight and her voice carefully polite, she says No, thank you, I’m sorry, and the man goes away. Who was that, Mama? they say. Oh, no one, she says.\nThey are sitting down to dinner but they have to wait because the doorbell rings and a thin young boy begins to tell their father about a Sales Program he’s completing for a scholarship to be Supervisor, and he holds up a filthy tattered little booklet and lifts also his desperate guile and heavily guarded hope, and the children’s father says, No thank you, sorry but I can’t help you out this time, and the boy goes away. The children start to eat and don’t ask anything, because the boy was just a boy, but their father acts irritated and hasty when he sits back down.\nOnce a glassy-eyed heavy girl who almost seems asleep as she stands outside their door offers for sale some little handtowels stitched by the blind people at the Lighthouse for the Blind and the children are in the folds of their mother’s full skirt listening to the girl’s small voice and their mother says, Well, I bought some the last time.\nShe buys the children school supplies and food, she pays the two boys for mowing the yard together and weeding her flower bed. She gets a new sewing machine for her birthday from the children’s father, and she buys fabric and thread and patterns and makes dresses for the girls, to save money. She tells the children each to put a dime or quarter into the collection plate at Church, and once a month she puts in a little sealed white envelope, and the ushers move slowly along the ends of the pews weaving the baskets through the congregation, and the organist plays a long piece of music.\nWhisk brooms, magazine subscriptions, anything you need hauled away, little league raffle tickets, cookies, chocolate candy, can I do any yard work again and again, hairbrushes, Christmas cards, do you need help with your ironing one time, and more, came calling at the front door while the children were sometimes eating, sometimes playing. Their faces would soften with a kind of comfort in the authority of mother or father, with a kind of wonder at the needy callers.\nTheir father left for work every day early, and came home for dinner, and almost always went again on Saturday; in his car. Their mother opened a savings account for each child and into each put the first five dollars. The children felt proud to see their names in the passbooks, and wanted to know when they could take the money out. But they were told they had to save their money not spend it. They felt a kind of pleasure in these mysteries, to know that there were things you would understand later when you grew up and had your own house and while your children were eating their dinner and making too much noise the way you did, you knew it was true, the doorbell would ring, the familiar surprise of it, who would it be, and someone would be holding a little worn book or a bundle of dishtowels or once an old man, but perhaps he only looked old, with his beard, came with bunches of carnations, white, red, and pink, and he too was turned away.",

O, let not virtue seek\n\nRemuneration for the thing it was;\n\nFor beauty, wit,\n\nHigh birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,\n\nLove, friendship, charity, are subjects all\n\nTo envious and calumniating time.\n\nOne touch of nature makes the whole world kin,\n\nThat all with one consent praise new-born gawds,\n\nThough they are made and moulded of things past,\n\nAnd give to dust that is a little gilt\n\nMore laud than gilt o'er-dusted.\n\nThe present eye praises the present object.\n\nThen marvel not, thou great and complete man,\n\nThat all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;\n\nSince things in motion sooner catch the eye\n\nThan what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,\n\nAnd still it might, and yet it may again,\n\nIf thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive\n\nAnd case thy reputation in thy tent;\n\nWhose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,\n\nMade emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves\n\nAnd drave great Mars to faction.",

He held us up to the world for it to see,\nthree children that were good, who understood love in a quiet way,\nwho owned nothing but calloused hands and true freedom,\nand that is how he made us: he offered us to the wind,\nto the mountains, to the skies of autumn and spring.\nHe said, “Here are my children! Care for them!”\nAnd he left again, going somewhere like a child\nwith a warrior’s heart, nothing could stop him.\nMy grandmother would look at him for a long time,\nand then she would say nothing.\nShe chose to remain silent, praying each night,\nguiding down like a root in the heart of earth,\nclutching sunlight and rains to her ancient breast.\nAnd I am the blossom of many nights.\nA threefold blossom: my sister is as she is,\nmy brother is as he is, and I am as I am.\nThrough sacred ceremony of living, daily living,\narose three distinct hopes, three loves,\nout of the long felt nights and days of yesterday.",

More often, tourists,\nwho kneel and weep at mysterious shrines.\nShe knows how often mail arrives,\nhow rarely there is a letter.\nWhen one comes, she announces it, a miracle,\nlistening to it read again and again\nin the dim evening light.\n\nMy grandmother’s voice says nothing can surprise her.\nTake her the shotgun wound and the crippled baby.\nShe knows the spaces we travel through,\nthe messages we cannot send—our voices are short\nand would get lost on the journey.\nFarewell to the husband’s coat,\nthe ones she has loved and nourished,\nwho fly from her like seeds into a deep sky.\nThey will plant themselves. We will all die.\n\nMy grandmother’s eyes say Allah is everywhere, even in death.\nWhen she talks of the orchard and the new olive press,\nwhen she tells the stories of Joha and his foolish wisdoms,\nHe is her first thought, what she really thinks of is His name.\n“Answer, if you hear the words under the words—\notherwise it is just a world with a lot of rough edges,\ndifficult to get through, and our pockets full of stones.”",

The last Tuscarora Eel\ndied out a generation ago, so we are left\nOnondaga Eels among the Tuscarora,\nvoiceless as well as legless.\n\n\n3\n\n\nI find an encyclopedia photo,\nsee jagged rows of razor teeth\nin a mouth perpetually grinning\nand when I show it to her, she says\nclans are a system to keep track\nof families, so we don’t inadvertently\nmarry our relatives, and that we have no\nmore affinity with eels than anyone else\non the reservation has with their animals.\n\n\n4\n\n\n“If I threw you in the dike,” she says\n“you’d drown as fast as anyone else,” done\nwith this lesson. I remember older cousins,\nswimming between my legs, and suddenly I am rising,\ntheir hands grabbing my knees as my balls collide\nwith the backs of their necks, and they break\nthe surface, toss me into deeper water, probably\nwatching to make sure I surface, after they’ve had\nsome amusement at my struggle.\n\n\n5\n\n\nIn wet darkness, I imagine opening\nmy eyes and mouth, taking water in,\nfilling my lungs, discovering gills\nlike Aquaman or Namor, the Sub-mariner.\nKnowing I had better odds of dying, face down,\nno voice to call out for help, I am\nnever quite brave enough to try it, not daring\nenough, even, to open my eyes when my face breaks\nthe stillness of river water contained.\n\n\n6\n\n\nBut I flip on my back, ears below the surface, listen\nto mysteries, breathe shallowly at that level, and float,\nwondering what it would be like to glide the depths\non fins, knowing if I were there, I would desire\nlegs and lungs, and then I fill my chest to capacity,\nand dive, loving and begrudging the ache I find there,\nthe throbbing of my chest begging for release,\nand I swim back up, eyes still closed, wondering how\nlong it will take to find the surface again.",

It hurt that he didn’t invite\nme to the dinner after his Dia reading\nor to the reception after his reading at the\n92nd Street Y, though he did, at the latter,\nread “Mood Indigo,” dedicated to me.\nWhen he said my name from the stage,\nJoan and Eileen, sitting to my left, turned\nand stared at me; frozen by the enormity\nof the moment, I couldn’t look back.\nWhen he came to a reading I gave at\nSt. Mark’s, Raymond impressed upon\nme what an honor it was: Jimmy didn’t\ngo to many poetry readings. What else\nis there to say? That when I visited him\nat St. Vincent’s the day before he died\nDarragh said, “He likes to hear gossip.”\nSo I said, “Eileen and I are talking again.”\nThat at his funeral I sat alone (Ira couldn’t\ncome); that that was the loneliest feeling\nin the world. That afterwards Doug said\n“You look so sad.” How should I have\nlooked, Doug! And that a year after he\ndied, I dreamt I saw him in the lobby of\nthe Chelsea Hotel. He was wearing a\nhospital shift and seemed to have no\nmuscle control over his face—like in inten-\nsive care after his stroke. He saw me\nand said, “It’s nice to see some familiar\nfaces.” I approached him, but he\ndisappeared.",

    "text": "1. I know that language is within the world and that, at the same time, the world is within language. I know we are at the border between language and the world.\n\n2. I don’t like phrases such as “nothing new under the sun” or “it’s all been said already.” I know that at every moment we could affirm: “everything is always new under the sun” or “almost nothing has yet been said of what could be said.”\n\n3. I know that there’s no true coherence except in apparent incoherence. Every object clothes itself in chaos. To take shape, every thought must manage its own vagueness.\n\n4. Among the obvious: I know that every human activity consists, one way or another, of battling death.\n\n5. I know that time is bound up with space. Time is the shadow of space. Space the shadow of time. I know that we live in the shadow of a shadow and that it returns to the light.\n\n6. I know that I know nothing about love.\n\n7. I know that I live not in the world, but in the shadow of the world. I know that I go through the world the way an insect goes through its entire life in the shadow of a bank.\n\n8. I know that nothing is simple. Or more, that what’s simple is never truly, never completely, so. I know that everything adds up and that every element of this total depends on the whole.\n\n9. I know that everything around me is nothing but a mass of contingency. I know that every word props itself up on an immense architecture of contingency.\n\n10. I know that thunder comes after lightning and sometimes, in my dreams, thunder precedes lightning. I know that to see its opposite simultaneously with every phenomenon you must widen your eyes.\n\n11. I know that whoever finds himself loses himself a little.\n\n12. I know that I love a woman enormously, but I don’t know which one.\n\n13. I know that to talk is to walk a path with emptiness to the right and emptiness to the left. I know that nothing can grasp this path with two ends. I know that writing is talking in frozen time.\n\n14. I know that the word “table” is like a thousand tables. That a phrase is like a thousand thousand phrases. And that thinking is a match for water sports.\n\n15. I know that every authentic poet is in decay.\n\n16. To read isn’t necessarily to analyze, is not necessarily “to understand.” At the swimming pool, we don’t ask the swimmer the composition of the water, the number and distribution of swimmers, or why he’s picked this date to go swimming. We don’t ask him to describe, in mid-crawl, the architecture or acoustics of the place, or to explain a bird trapped under its roof, or to do a better imitation of the progress of some Olympic seal. We don’t ask him to memorize opening hours or screw himself up by whistling from the bench throughout an entire race in butterfly stroke. No. Finally, we don’t ask him, before each dive, to bring up some secret meaning from the very bottom of the pool. No. We let swimmers swim. We let swimmers swim. And the swimming pools fill up.\n\n17. I know that I live and think inside a storehouse of books. Some recent, new, remarkable books, but in the great majority books which are decayed, moldy, have turned to the lightest heaps of dust. Only their metal frames and some fine particles of knowledge remain, unusable. Light from a few windows crosses the storehouse unimpeded.\n\n18. Having found some daguerreotypes on the floor of an attic—portraits eroded by time and light—I know that forgetting is something enormous, that forgetting is our highest destiny.\n\n19. I know that God doesn’t exist. That’s written everywhere in the storehouse—it can be made out through the portholes, too. I know that after death there’s nothing but death.\n\n20. I know that, seen from the border between language and the world, the universe is in increasing entropy. But I no longer know what it is if I climb to the top of a tree (one of these trees on the border between language and the world), from where you can see far into language and far into the world at the same time.\n\n21. Because I have scaled a tree, I know that beyond language is a huge plain, with dark flowers and little mazy footpaths.",

Brown-petal etchings and drawings:\nnut-brown, browner, irreclaimable rills\n\nof iron-gall ink sucked and feathered into\nthe paper's wan cusps and culverts. The ink...it's as if\nthere's no pulling away from the wet, flowing line\nto the tiny hedge-village perched on the edge of the cliff\n\nand the paper. Here the ink's overwatered\nand we barely, down in the forested loam,\ndisengage the gentle saint, his rounded hat molding\nhis crown like thatch on low rooftrees...St. Jerome.\n\n\n2\n\nHunched, sunk in a deep-toned wash,\nhe cares only for the huge, softleaved book\npropped on his knees. At nightfall Jerome swallowed up\nby his Bible misses the wistful look\n\nof his lion withdrawn to the forested ridge,\nthe drawing's diagonal. And from there, one can say\nthat landscape exists: prowls and spinnies\nwhere a lion might wind a lioness, or his prey...\n\nHe looks out on tree-clouded peaks, tiny hamlets,\ntwo lambs in a wattle-fold. What the lion sees, we see.\nFor Jerome, though, the lion is Judah, his seal and seed—\nJesse's stem drops thickset leaves for him to read.\n\n\n3\n\nSaskia, of course, thrones in painting. Still,\ntiny sketches tumble from odd cabinets:\nthe dear in a lopsided turban or twilled\ngarden hat, sketched \"on my wedding-day\"—\n\nSaskia. A cluster of lines, a rippled race\nof curls and cloudsets. And, for a rarity,\nin Rembrandt, flowers. The simple, surprised, smiling face\nof Saskia as Flora...After her fourth lying-in\n\n(she was dying), he took to long walks\non the city's outskirts; his sketchbook came home\nwith mere touches of charcoal, a reed, a waterfowl,\nestuarial shallows unfolding to the rim.\n\n\n4\n\nNow life is meaner, chaotic. Rushes of arousal,\nlawsuits, debts...this print of a kitchen drab,\neyes wandering, mouth a vacant, uptilted half-lune,\nher work-swollen hands on Saskia's velvet shawl,\n\nThe thighs parted, abdomen pear-pendulant,\nthe pulled-off stocking-stays grooved in the flab\nto her copse of cross-hatchings—No one\nwants to see this. But his hand made\n\nthis stock, of himself the substance and seed. Fine-\nspun cosmos, brown tangle, soft sign:\nthe old man spares us nothing. The book,\nthe look, the lieu, the end of the Line.",

My colors fly!\nI’m ready now to fight!\n\n\n“Let those who think that Bartow Black,—\nAn office-holder, too!—\nWill to the cowards show his back,\nTheir vain presumption rue!”\n\nBartow pursued his office game,\nAnd made the money, too,\nBut home at nights he wisely came\nAnd played the husband true.\n\nWhen they had got their subject tame,\nAnd well-matured their plan,\nThey at the hour of midnight came,\nAnd armed was every man!\n\nThey numbered fifty Southern sons,\nAnd masked was every face;\nAnd Winfield rifles were their guns,—\nYou could that plainly trace.\n\nOne Southern brave did have a key,\nAn entrance quick to make;\nThey entered all; but meek, you see,\nTheir victim not to wake!\n\nThey reached his room! He was in bed,—\nHis wife was by his side!\nThey struck a match above his head,—\nHis eyes he opened wide!\n\nPoor Bartow could not reach his gun,\nThough quick his arm did stretch,\nFor twenty bullets through him spun,\nThat stiffly laid the wretch.\n\nAnd then they rolled his carcass o’er,\nAnd filled both sides with lead;\nAnd then they turned it on the floor,\nAnd shot away his head!\n\nEre Black his bloody end did meet\nHis wife had swooned away;\nThe Southern braves did now retreat,—\nThere was no need to stay!",

    "text": "Every morning the maple leaves.\nEvery morning another chapter where the hero shifts\nfrom one foot to the other. Every morning the same big\nand little words all spelling out desire, all spelling out\nYou will be alone always and then you will die.\nSo maybe I wanted to give you something more than a catalog\nof non-definitive acts,\nsomething other than the desperation.\nDear So-and-So, I’m sorry I couldn’t come to your party.\nDear So-and-So, I’m sorry I came to your party\nand seduced you\nand left you bruised and ruined, you poor sad thing.\nYou want a better story. Who wouldn’t?\nA forest, then. Beautiful trees. And a lady singing.\nLove on the water, love underwater, love, love and so on.\nWhat a sweet lady. Sing lady, sing! Of course, she wakes the dragon.\nLove always wakes the dragon and suddenly\nflames everywhere.\nI can tell already you think I’m the dragon,\nthat would be so like me, but I’m not. I’m not the dragon.\nI’m not the princess either.\nWho am I? I’m just a writer. I write things down.\nI walk through your dreams and invent the future. Sure,\nI sink the boat of love, but that comes later. And yes, I swallow\nglass, but that comes later.\nAnd the part where I push you\nflush against the wall and every part of your body rubs against the bricks,\nshut up\nI’m getting to it.\nFor a while I thought I was the dragon.\nI guess I can tell you that now. And, for a while, I thought I was\nthe princess,\ncotton candy pink, sitting there in my room, in the tower of the castle,\nyoung and beautiful and in love and waiting for you with\nconfidence\nbut the princess looks into her mirror and only sees the princess,\nwhile I’m out here, slogging through the mud, breathing fire,\nand getting stabbed to death.\nOkay, so I’m the dragon. Big deal.\nYou still get to be the hero.\nYou get magic gloves! A fish that talks! You get eyes like flashlights!\nWhat more do you want?\nI make you pancakes, I take you hunting, I talk to you as if you’re\nreally there.\nAre you there, sweetheart? Do you know me? Is this microphone live?\nLet me do it right for once,\nfor the record, let me make a thing of cream and stars that becomes,\nyou know the story, simply heaven.\nInside your head you hear a phone ringing\nand when you open your eyes\nonly a clearing with deer in it. Hello deer.\nInside your head the sound of glass,\na car crash sound as the trucks roll over and explode in slow motion.\nHello darling, sorry about that.\nSorry about the bony elbows, sorry we\nlived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell\nand how I ruined everything by saying it out loud.\nEspecially that, but I should have known.\nYou see, I take the parts that I remember and stitch them back together\nto make a creature that will do what I say\nor love me back.\nI’m not really sure why I do it, but in this version you are not\nfeeding yourself to a bad man\nagainst a black sky prickled with small lights.\nI take it back.\nThe wooden halls like caskets. These terms from the lower depths.\nI take them back.\nHere is the repeated image of the lover destroyed.\nCrossed out.\nClumsy hands in a dark room. Crossed out. There is something\nunderneath the floorboards.\nCrossed out. And here is the tabernacle\nreconstructed.\nHere is the part where everyone was happy all the time and we were all\nforgiven,\neven though we didn’t deserve it.\nInside your head you hear\na phone ringing, and when you open your eyes you’re washing up\nin a stranger’s bathroom,\nstanding by the window in a yellow towel, only twenty minutes away\nfrom the dirtiest thing you know.\nAll the rooms of the castle except this one, says someone, and suddenly\ndarkness,\nsuddenly only darkness.\nIn the living room, in the broken yard,\nin the back of the car as the lights go by. In the airport\nbathroom’s gurgle and flush, bathed in a pharmacy of\nunnatural light,\nmy hands looking weird, my face weird, my feet too far away.\nAnd then the airplane, the window seat over the wing with a view\nof the wing and a little foil bag of peanuts.\nI arrived in the city and you met me at the station,\nsmiling in a way\nthat made me frightened. Down the alley, around the arcade,\nup the stairs of the building\nto the little room with the broken faucets, your drawings, all your things,\nI looked out the window and said\nThis doesn’t look that much different from home,\nbecause it didn’t,\nbut then I noticed the black sky and all those lights.\nWe walked through the house to the elevated train.\nAll these buildings, all that glass and the shiny beautiful\nmechanical wind.\nWe were inside the train car when I started to cry. You were crying too,\nsmiling and crying in a way that made me\neven more hysterical. You said I could have anything I wanted, but I\njust couldn’t say it out loud.\nActually, you said Love, for you,\nis larger than the usual romantic love. It’s like a religion. It’s\nterrifying. No one\nwill ever want to sleep with you.",

Betray\nNo least suspicion\nThe necessities within\nCould vanish at her\nWill. Try not to think\nThat as she feeds, gains\nSpecific gravity,\nShe shrinks, light-\nless as the world’s\nHard core\nAnd the per-\nspective drains\nIn her.\nFinally, above all,\nYou must not ever see,\nOr let slip one hint you can see,\nOn the other side, the girl’s\nCuffs, like cordovan restraints;\nForget her bony, tentative wrist,\nThe half-fed, worrying eyes, and how\nShe backs out, bows, and tries to bow\nOut of the scene, grows too ethereal\nTo make a shape inside her dress\nAnd the dress itself is beginning already\nTo sublime itself away like a vapor\nThat merges into the empty twinkling\nOf the air and of the bright wallpaper.",

Mysteries that fasten themselves to my chest.\nAll I want is not to see businesses nor gardens\nnor markets nor eyeglasses nor elevators.\n\nIn order to serve all radio listeners,\nwithout discriminating between social classes, I speak a tongue\nthat fills hearts with the law of communicating clouds.\nI have my brain or whatever it is full of skull moths.\nFor the world to go on being what it is it must\n—per force—take another form.\n\nTrue poems are fires. When something cherished burns\ninstead of the fireman I call, rushes forth the incendiary.\nIt says: live, live, live!\nIt is Death.",

    "text": "Lonnie didn’t want to eat with Clifford.\nI tried to keep my eyes away from his mouth,\nWhich opened uncontrollably,\nHis thick saliva oozing over him.\nAnd he couldn’t talk.\nSo I ate my lunch with Lonnie, heard him talk\nAbout the dive which broke his neck, about\nHis motorcycle shop in Chico, while\nAnother nurse gave Clifford lunch.\n\nEvery day\nHis parents came to push his chair around\nThe grounds. A grim, determined pair;\nI wondered what disasters they had seen.\nThe nurses talked with them about\nTheir son. His eyes are beautiful, they said.\nOne day a nurse who put her stethoscope\nTo Clifford’s chest could not detect a beat.\n“His heart has stopped,” she said in quiet awe.\nThe P.A. speakers cried:\nCODE BLUE, C-2, STAT! CODE BLUE, C-2, STAT!\nThe doctors, nurses and technicians ran\nInto our crowded room. The squeaking\nCrash cart could not be heard above\nThe urgent, human sounds the doctors made:\nA swirl of orders filled the air. “I need\nThe mallet quick, goddamnit, QUICK, I said!”\nEncapsulated in my iron lung,\nI noted that doctors weren’t the calm\nProfessionals portrayed by Robert Young\nAnd Richard Chamberlain, but people just\nAs scared of death as everybody else.\nThen, they took me, iron lung and all,\nAnd parked me in a room\nWhere women patients spend their lives.\n\nThe room was quiet as a stone; no clocks\nOr television sets marked the time,\nWhich passed as slowly as Moses climbing Mount Sinai,\nUntil the social worker, Mrs. Mintzer,\nCame to talk to me about Shakespeare. All his tragedies,\nShe said, contain a point where things begin\nTo fall apart. The bold protagonist,\nNo matter what his cunning, skill or strength,\nCan see his fall foreshadowed by a small\nEvent. Macbeth saw Banquo at the feast\nAnd after that it went from bad to worse\nUntil the murd’rous thane became a corpse\nWithout a head. She paused to think a while.\nNow Clifford led a fairly normal life,\nShe pointed out, despite his cerebral palsy.\nPlaying cards and camping with his family\nWere not beyond his reach.\nThe point where things fell apart occurred\nFive years ago, when he fell and broke\nHis shoulder bone.\n“Clifford died,” she said.\nAnd tried to comfort me with her sympathy\nFor my awful loss.\n\nI didn’t mourn his death at all.\n“Too bad he died so young,” I said,\nAt twenty-three.” But all I cared about\nWas the space in my crowded room.\nThe p.m. nurses took me back into my room.\nI asked one to play my tape,\nAppalachian Spring.\nShe reached into my bedside stand and slipped.\n“There’s blood all over the floor, Clifford’s.\nI thought they’d cleaned up all that mess.”\n\nI spent the weekend after that in the solarium.\nI read and overheard the nurses in the next room.\n“They say he wrote exquisite poetry\nAbout the way he felt when people stared\nAt him as if he were a freak.”\n\nAnd so\nI learned of my insensitivity,\nInsensitivity so great I failed\nTo recognize a person\nCaught in much the same predicament as I.\nSuch numbness isolates me more\nThan any iron lung.",

    "text": "Something needs to be done—like dragging a big black plastic sack through the upstairs rooms, emptying into it each waste basket, the trash of three lives for a week or so. I am careful and slow about it, so that this little chore will banish the big ones. But I leave the bag lying on the floor and I go into my daughter’s bedroom, into the north morning light from her windows, and while this minute she is at school counting or spelling a first useful word I sit down on her unmade bed and I look out the windows at nothing for a while, the unmoving buildings—houses and a church—in the cold street.\nAcross it a dark young man is coming slowly down the white sidewalk with a snowshovel over his shoulder. He’s wearing a light coat, there’s a plastic showercap under his dirty navy blue knit hat, and at a house where the walk hasn’t been cleared he climbs the steps and rings the doorbell and stands waiting, squinting sideways at the wind. Then he half wakes and he says a few words I can’t hear to the storm door that doesn’t open, and he nods his head with the kindly farewell that is a habit he wears as disguise, and he goes back down the steps and on to the next house. All of this in pantomime, the way I see it through windows closed against winter and the faint sounds of winter.\nMy daughter’s cross-eyed piggy bank is also staring out blankly, and in its belly are four dollar bills that came one at a time from her grandmother and which tomorrow she will pull out of the corked mouthhole. (It’s not like the piggy banks you have to fill before you empty them because to empty them you have to smash them.) Tomorrow she will buy a perfect piece of small furniture for her warm well-lit dollhouse where no one is tired or weak and the wind can’t get in.\nSitting on her bed, looking out, I didn’t see a bundled-up lame child out of school and even turned out of the house for a while, or a blind woman with burns or a sick bald veteran—people who might have walked past stoop-shouldered with what’s happened and will keep happening to them. So much limping is not from physical pain—the pain is gone now, but the leg’s still crooked. The piggy bank and I see only the able young man whose straight back nobody needs.\nWhen he finally gets past where I can see him, it feels as if a kind of music has stopped, and it’s more completely quiet than it was, an emptiness more than a stillness, and I get up from the rumpled bed and I smooth the covers, slowly and carefully, and I look around the room for something to pick up or straighten, and I take a wadded dollar bill from my pocket and put it into the pig and I walk out.",

Why yet dare we not trust,\nThough with unkneaded dough-bak'd prose, thy dust,\nSuch as th' unscissor'd churchman from the flower\nOf fading rhetoric, short-liv'd as his hour,\nDry as the sand that measures it, should lay\nUpon thy ashes, on the funeral day?\nHave we no voice, no tune? Didst thou dispense\nThrough all our language, both the words and sense?\n'Tis a sad truth. The pulpit may her plain\nAnd sober Christian precepts still retain,\nDoctrines it may, and wholesome uses, frame,\nGrave homilies and lectures, but the flame\nOf thy brave soul (that shot such heat and light\nAs burnt our earth and made our darkness bright,\nCommitted holy rapes upon our will,\nDid through the eye the melting heart distil,\nAnd the deep knowledge of dark truths so teach\nAs sense might judge what fancy could not reach)\nMust be desir'd forever. So the fire\nThat fills with spirit and heat the Delphic quire,\nWhich, kindled first by thy Promethean breath,\nGlow'd here a while, lies quench'd now in thy death.\nThe Muses' garden, with pedantic weeds\nO'erspread, was purg'd by thee; the lazy seeds\nOf servile imitation thrown away,\nAnd fresh invention planted; thou didst pay\nThe debts of our penurious bankrupt age;\nLicentious thefts, that make poetic rage\nA mimic fury, when our souls must be\nPossess'd, or with Anacreon's ecstasy,\nOr Pindar's, not their own; the subtle cheat\nOf sly exchanges, and the juggling feat\nOf two-edg'd words, or whatsoever wrong\nBy ours was done the Greek or Latin tongue,\nThou hast redeem'd, and open'd us a mine\nOf rich and pregnant fancy; drawn a line\nOf masculine expression, which had good\nOld Orpheus seen, or all the ancient brood\nOur superstitious fools admire, and hold\nTheir lead more precious than thy burnish'd gold,\nThou hadst been their exchequer, and no more\nThey each in other's dust had rak'd for ore.\nThou shalt yield no precedence, but of time,\nAnd the blind fate of language, whose tun'd chime\nMore charms the outward sense; yet thou mayst claim\nFrom so great disadvantage greater fame,\nSince to the awe of thy imperious wit\nOur stubborn language bends, made only fit\nWith her tough thick-ribb'd hoops to gird about\nThy giant fancy, which had prov'd too stout\nFor their soft melting phrases. As in time\nThey had the start, so did they cull the prime\nBuds of invention many a hundred year,\nAnd left the rifled fields, besides the fear\nTo touch their harvest; yet from those bare lands\nOf what is purely thine, thy only hands,\n(And that thy smallest work) have gleaned more\nThan all those times and tongues could reap before.\nBut thou art gone, and thy strict laws will be\nToo hard for libertines in poetry;\nThey will repeal the goodly exil'd train\nOf gods and goddesses, which in thy just reign\nWere banish'd nobler poems; now with these,\nThe silenc'd tales o' th'Metamorphoses\nShall stuff their lines, and swell the windy page,\nTill verse, refin'd by thee, in this last age\nTurn ballad rhyme, or those old idols be\nAdor'd again, with new apostasy.\nOh, pardon me, that break with untun'd verse\nThe reverend silence that attends thy hearse,\nWhose awful solemn murmurs were to thee,\nMore than these faint lines, a loud elegy,\nThat did proclaim in a dumb eloquence\nThe death of all the arts; whose influence,\nGrown feeble, in these panting numbers lies,\nGasping short-winded accents, and so dies.\nSo doth the swiftly turning wheel not stand\nIn th' instant we withdraw the moving hand,\nBut some small time maintain a faint weak course,\nBy virtue of the first impulsive force;\nAnd so, whilst I cast on thy funeral pile\nThy crown of bays, oh, let it crack awhile,\nAnd spit disdain, till the devouring flashes\nSuck all the moisture up, then turn to ashes.\nI will not draw the envy to engross\nAll thy perfections, or weep all our loss;\nThose are too numerous for an elegy,\nAnd this too great to be express'd by me.\nThough every pen should share a distinct part,\nYet art thou theme enough to tire all art;\nLet others carve the rest, it shall suffice\nI on thy tomb this epitaph incise:\nHere lies a king, that rul'd as he thought fit\nThe universal monarchy of wit;\nHere lie two flamens, and both those, the best,\nApollo's first, at last, the true God's priest.",

    "text": "Always the evening noises, the footsteps on the stairs, the day that rises in the throat.\nA turn of the key will expel the world.\nAgainst the extinct forest of furniture, the channeled bloodstream translates the dream into this small life.\n\nIn the end we shrink until finally we can no longer inhabit the gestures of our childhood.\n\nA nail in a board: the remains of a fence; blurred memory of the mountain that raised the tree, that brooded over its ore.\n\nModest against a hedge, a spade dreams its beautiful death.\n“Simple and calm,” nourished on weeds and wind, the image moves, distilling its own memory. Far off, we disappear into the ochre and the gold, the mud-brown and the primordial green.\n\nThe slightest evidence of life. In the courtyard's silence, the barking of that dog. A shutter, merely, that's banging. Those books stacked in one corner of the room. Everything that, ordinarily, follows its automated course. And there, all at once: the happiness that spreads its billion pinpricks through the body.\n\nEvening's voice unreels its argument. Five floors below, the courtyard and its echoes. The barking still, and overhead the footsteps of regret in the maids' rooms. I'll try to have given each thing my word before giving in to sleep.\n\nThe room breathes deeply the music of a quartet. It's that grave well-being, unexpectedly, you know?\nNobody. You may speak. I'm not there.\n\nA gesture: the garden diffuses the pale green taste of currants. One remains quiet as long as possible.\nAnother gesture: the sun rips open the scent of the lindens. Childhood leaps over the wall.\nThe miracle would be having something to say.\n\nMaybe we could have inhabited that smile, over there, at the other end of the room; or else we could have met at the improbable dawn of memory. Maybe we could have fallen asleep in the twilight of this autumn when the brain is nothing more than oak and leather.\nBut we have only this thin life to place beneath the axe.\n\nThe crows in the plowed field, black against the field's ochre, gleaming and black amid the smell of moist earth, a smell mixed with the brush and bark and roots that the wind returns as someone somewhere burns them.\nAnd then that pile of words that rots with helplessness.\n\nIn the forest, the sound, dry and brief, of a pebble in a streambed, fallen after patient millennia into the earth's darkness. Just a dry sound and its echo, quickly engulfed by birdcalls. And later, on the path, drops of blood from the trees.\n\nA farmer carriers his tools slowly toward the shed. In the atmospheric silence, a woodpecker registers the sound of its life's work. That's all. Some animals, a pile of wood, and the smell of rain, which always calls to mind something that can't quite be reconstructed.\n\nAcrid smoke; and then that crackling of the woods in the clearing. A few centimeters above the cut weeds, the tenuous vapor of memory.\nBetween eyelashes, amid the colors of the woods, the colors of weeds, and earth, that sky, that patch of sky, that sky.\n\nThe courtyard, the wood bench, the sputtering of the fishpond, the smell of humus, the smell of mushroom.\nFive notes in the rain sketch the presence of a bird.\n\nThe village, the morning, belong to the birds. Images flow freely through the alleys. Silence full of events: the eyes prey on a shadow. A gull's passing reshapes all the shores of the world.\n\nBirdcalls cut through the fog, wet grass: morning. The rectangle of a wall says: “blank,” nothing else. On the horizon, very nearby, a woman dressed in black glides silently across her wide open destiny.\n\nBetween branches, near the sun, the moon, which opens the night to the night. I sink, gently, and disappear. On the surface, alone, the cry of an owl keeps watch.\n\nThe stairs, the brass doorknob, the smell of dark corners. The iron bed, the red bedspread. Slow breathing. That song that waits for nothing but our melody.\n\nWe are of the morning, of the gently sloping hour that comes slowly down from the sun. The old clothes in the corner are tinged with the morning's color, which will have to be worn. The lark's song widens the silence.\n\nDeep in the forest, the cuckoo, the woodpecker, the chiaroscuro of ancient musics. Heavy wagons clench their signal-lights toward the heights of the opaque sky. I moved with closed words across the homeland that sleeps me.\n\nFrom this far country, where you respond to me without my hearing a word of yours, without perhaps my words ever reaching you, from this country where perhaps we understand each other, I overhear the most contradictory noises, which veil and deny your voice, and which would like to make me believe that I'm speaking alone.",

Yet I endure.\nI ask the Earth, have not the mountains felt?\nI ask yon Heaven, the all-beholding Sun,\nHas it not seen? The Sea, in storm or calm,\nHeaven's ever-changing Shadow, spread below,\nHave its deaf waves not heard my agony?\nAh me! alas, pain, pain ever, for ever!\n\nThe crawling glaciers pierce me with the spears\nOf their moon-freezing crystals, the bright chains\nEat with their burning cold into my bones.\nHeaven's wingèd hound, polluting from thy lips\nHis beak in poison not his own, tears up\nMy heart; and shapeless sights come wandering by,\nThe ghastly people of the realm of dream,\nMocking me: and the Earthquake-fiends are charged\nTo wrench the rivets from my quivering wounds\nWhen the rocks split and close again behind:\nWhile from their loud abysses howling throng\nThe genii of the storm, urging the rage\nOf whirlwind, and afflict me with keen hail.\nAnd yet to me welcome is day and night,\nWhether one breaks the hoar frost of the morn,\nOr starry, dim, and slow, the other climbs\nThe leaden-coloured east; for then they lead\nThe wingless, crawling hours, one among whom\n—As some dark Priest hales the reluctant victim—\nShall drag thee, cruel King, to kiss the blood\nFrom these pale feet, which then might trample thee\nIf they disdained not such a prostrate slave.\nDisdain! Ah no! I pity thee. What ruin\nWill hunt thee undefended through wide Heaven!\nHow will thy soul, cloven to its depth with terror,\nGape like a hell within! I speak in grief,\nNot exultation, for I hate no more,\nAs then ere misery made me wise. The curse\nOnce breathed on thee I would recall. Ye Mountains,\nWhose many-voicèd Echoes, through the mist\nOf cataracts, flung the thunder of that spell!\nYe icy Springs, stagnant with wrinkling frost,\nWhich vibrated to hear me, and then crept\nShuddering through India! Thou serenest Air,\nThrough which the Sun walks burning without beams!\nAnd ye swift Whirlwinds, who on poisèd wings\nHung mute and moveless o'er yon hushed abyss,\nAs thunder, louder than your own, made rock\nThe orbèd world! If then my words had power,\nThough I am changed so that aught evil wish\nIs dead within; although no memory be\nOf what is hate, let them not lose it now!\nWhat was that curse? for ye all heard me speak.",

    "text": "First, J. Robert Oppenheimer wrote his paper on dwarf stars—“What happens to a massive star that burns out?” he asked. His calculations suggested that instead of collapsing it would contract indefinitely, under the force of its own gravity. The bright star would disappear but it would still be there, where there had been brilliance there would be a blank. Soon after, workers built Oak Ridge, the accumulation of Cemesto hutments not placed on any map. They built a church, a school, a bowling alley. From all over, families drove through the muddy ruts. The ground swelled about the ruts like flesh stitched by sutures. My father, a child, watched the loads on the tops of their cars tip. Gates let everyone in and out with a pass. Forbidden to tell anyone they were there, my father’s family moved in, quietly, behind the chain-link fence. Niels Bohr said, “This bomb might be our great hope.” My father watched his parents eat breakfast: his father opened his newspaper across the plate of bacon and eggs, his mother smoked Camel straights, the ash from her cigarette cometing across the back of the obituaries. They spoke little. Increasingly the mother drank Wild Turkey with her women friends from the bowling league. Generators from the\ny\n-12 plant droned their ambition. There were no birds. General Leslie Groves marched the boardwalks, yelled, his boots pressed the slates and the mud bubbled up like viscera. My father watched his father enter the plant. My shy father went to the library, which was a trailer with a circus tent painted on the side. There he read the definition of “uranium” which was worn to a blur. My father read one Hardy Boys mystery after another. It was August 1945. The librarian smiled sympathetically at the 12-year-old boy. “Time to go home,” the librarian said. They named the bomb Little Boy. It weighed 9,700 pounds. It was the size of a go-kart. On the battle cruiser Augusta, President Truman said, “This is the greatest thing in history.” That evening, my father’s parents mentioned Japanese cities. Everyone was quiet. It was the quiet of the exhausted and the innocent. The quietness inside my father was building and would come to define him. I was wrong to judge it. Speak, Father, and I will listen. And if you do not wish to speak, then I will listen to that.",

    "text": "Am I to become profligate as if I were a blonde? Or religious as if I were French?\n\nEach time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous (and how the same names keep recurring on that interminable list!), but one of these days there’ll be nothing left with which to venture forth.\n\nWhy should I share you? Why don’t you get rid of someone else for a change?\n\nI am the least difficult of men. All I want is boundless love.\n\nEven trees understand me! Good heavens, I lie under them, too, don’t I? I’m just like a pile of leaves.\n\nHowever, I have never clogged myself with the praises of pastoral life, nor with nostalgia for an innocent past of perverted acts in pastures. No. One need never leave the confines of New York to get all the greenery one wishes—I can’t even enjoy a blade of grass unless I know there’s a subway handy, or a record store or some other sign that people do not totally regret life. It is more important to affirm the least sincere; the clouds get enough attention as it is and even they continue to pass. Do they know what they’re missing? Uh huh.\n\nMy eyes are vague blue, like the sky, and change all the time; they are indiscriminate but fleeting, entirely specific and disloyal, so that no one trusts me. I am always looking away. Or again at something after it has given me up. It makes me restless and that makes me unhappy, but I cannot keep them still. If only I had grey, green, black, brown, yellow eyes; I would stay at home and do something. It’s not that I am curious. On the contrary, I am bored but it’s my duty to be attentive, I am needed by things as the sky must be above the earth. And lately, so great has their anxiety become, I can spare myself little sleep.\n\nNow there is only one man I love to kiss when he is unshaven. Heterosexuality! you are inexorably approaching. (How discourage her?)\n\nSt. Serapion, I wrap myself in the robes of your whiteness which is like midnight in Dostoevsky. How am I to become a legend, my dear? I’ve tried love, but that hides you in the bosom of another and I am always springing forth from it like the lotus—the ecstasy of always bursting forth! (but one must not be distracted by it!) or like a hyacinth, “to keep the filth of life away,” yes, there, even in the heart, where the filth is pumped in and courses and slanders and pollutes and determines. I will my will, though I may become famous for a mysterious vacancy in that department, that greenhouse.\n\nDestroy yourself, if you don’t know!\n\nIt is easy to be beautiful; it is difficult to appear so. I admire you, beloved, for the trap you’ve set. It's like a final chapter no one reads because the plot is over.\n\n“Fanny Brown is run away—scampered off with a Cornet of Horse; I do love that little Minx, &amp; hope She may be happy, tho’ She has vexed me by this Exploit a little too. —Poor silly Cecchina! or F:B: as we used to call her. —I wish She had a good Whipping and 10,000 pounds.” —Mrs. Thrale.\n\nI’ve got to get out of here. I choose a piece of shawl and my dirtiest suntans. I’ll be back, I'll re-emerge, defeated, from the valley; you don’t want me to go where you go, so I go where you don’t want me to. It’s only afternoon, there’s a lot ahead. There won’t be any mail downstairs. Turning, I spit in the lock and the knob turns.",

The\nus\nHouse of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources have also announced investigations.\nLast week\nbp\nlaunched its own investigation into the incident and has an investigation team at work in Houston, Texas.\n\n—bp.com, April 28, 2010\n\nBeneath three thousand feet, the sea is wholly dark.\nThe shuttle feeds hydraulics to the blind shear ram\nand represents a single failure point for disconnect.\nRecommendation: Declare selected points on earth\ninvisible. Affected communities have been provided\nwith limited quantities of powdered milk\nand other staples. Many questions remain. Some\nclose their eyes under water instinctively.\nImagination can create a sense of peril where\nno real peril exists. Safety equipment tests\nwere necessarily imaginary; mechanisms in question\nwere wholly inaccessible. A journalist sinking\ninto the mud was told to toss his camera\nto a colleague and hold extremely still. In this\nsense, we are our own prisoners. Investigators\nhave salt in their hair and sand in their teeth.\nThe hotel pool is empty. Yet questions remain.\nBarbeque billboards depict grinning pigs in aprons\nand toques. Cleanup crews recover thousands\nof plastic milk jugs from the shallows. Do these\nimages appeal to the death drive? Care should be\ntaken to ensure the highest possible reliability\nfrom that valve. Thousands in affected communities\nhave been evicted and live in tents. Demonstrators\nhave prevented investigators from accessing\nhotel stairwells. 1900: Rudolf Diesel\ndemonstrates an engine fueled by peanut oil\nat the Paris World’s Fair. The Vietnamese owner\nof Bad Bob’s bbq Buffet tells a journalist\nshe last drank powdered milk in a refugee camp\n“a thousand years ago.” Items available only\nin limited quantities are found in Appendix C.\nCleanup crews have stacked thousands of drums\nof dispersant in hotel parking lots. Dominant\nfailure combinations for well control suggest\nadditional safety mechanism diversity\nand redundancy provide additional reliability.\nBank of America will offer limited foreclosure\ndeferments in affected communities. Thousands\nof years ago, a pronghorn ram slipped beneath\nthe surface of a tar pit, jerking its snout\nfor air. Recommendation: Live at inaccessible\nelevations. Recommendation: Close your eyes.\nRecommendation: Prevent access to the invisible.\nEngineering reports noted required safety\nmechanisms were unlikely to function yet were\nrequired for safety’s sake. If the committee\nmay offer an analogy, a blind surgeon is dangerous,\nan imaginary surgeon harmless. Still, questions\nremain. BP’s 2010 Q1 replacement cost profit\nwas $5,598 million, compared with $2,387 million\na year ago, an increase of 135%. Unlimited\nquantities of peanuts are available. However,\ncare must be taken to ensure continued high\nreliability of the shuttle valve, since it is\nextremely critical to the overall disconnect\noperation. Phenomena not meant to be accessed\nor imagined are found in Appendix E. Cleanup crews\nare sometimes idled for lack of fuel. 1913: Diesel\nfound dead, drowned under suspicious circumstances.\nThe investigators’ hotel toilets won’t flush.\nMidas turned everything he touched to gold.\nIn this sense, seabirds cloaked in oil are rich.\nCleanup crews live in tents and are provided\nwith limited quantities of barbeque and wear\nwhite canvas jumpsuits like prisoners on furlough.\nIf the committee may offer an analogy, the death\ndrive resides at wholly dark depths of imagination\nand fuel issues from a wound we’ve opened there.",

    "text": "These things I do remember; O I pour\nMy soul out for them. All the ages long\nHatred pursueth us; through all the years\nIgnorance like a monster hath devoured\nOur martyrs as in one long day of blood.\nRulers have rise through the endless years,\nOppressive, savage in their witless power,\nFilled with a futile thought: to make an end\nOf that which God had cherished. There was once\nA tyrant searching in the Book of God\nFor some word there to serve him as a sword\nTo slay us; and he found the line which spake:\n“He that doth steal a man and selleth him,\nHe shall be surely put to death.” That king,\nThat dark-designing servant of false gods,\nSummoned to him ten sages of the Law,\nSaying: “Pervert the truth not with your lies,\nBut judge this thing: What if a man be found\nStealing his brother—one of Israel’s sons—\nAnd making merchandise and selling him?”\nAnd the ten sages spake: “That thief shall die.”\n“Your fathers”—said the tyrant, “where are they,\nThat sold their brother to a company\nOf Ishmaelites? Lo, ye shall now receive\nJustice of Heaven upon you; for if they,\nWere now in life, then ye yourselves should judge;\nBut now ye bear on you your fathers’ sin.”\n“If we have sinned,” they said, “then we shall bear\nHis sentence, Whose compassion fills the world.”\n“Give us three days,” they spake. And they all looked\nUnto the High Priest, Rabbi Ishmael,\nSaying, “Arise, arise, pronounce the Name;\nKnow from our God if this be His decree.”\nThen Rabbi Ishmael, in purity,\nPronounced the Name, and rising up on high,\nMade question of the angel clothed in white,\nWho spake: “O righteous! O beloved! I,\nHearkening within the secret region, heard\nThat ye indeed be captured.” Thus he spake,\nAnd Rabbi Ishmael, descending, told\nHis fellows all their doom.\n\nAnd that dread king\nBade the ten sages to be slain in woe\nAnd torture. Lo! I saw them all:\nThey stepped out of the ages, and they walked\nBefore the deathless spirit that is mad\nWith hunger for destruction of God’s own.\nTwo of the great in Israel were brought forth\nTo slaughter first:—the High Priest Ishmael,\nAnd Rabban Simeon, son of Gamliel,\nA prince in Israel. And this one implored,\n“O slay me ere ye slay him, lest I see\nThe death of him who ministers to God!”\nAnd lo the lot fell, and they slew him first.\nAnd Ishmael raised the severed head and cried—\nBitterly loud as calls a trumpet blast:—\n“How is the tongue that taught the glorious Message\nBrought low to lick the dust!” And while he wept\nThe tyrant’s daughter stood, and gazing on\nHis beauty, made petition for his life\nWith vain entreaty. Terror makes me dumb\nTo tell the tortures that mine eyes beheld;\nOnly that when the murderous hand had reached\nHis brow, the holy symbol’s seat, he cried\nWith one most bitter cry to his soul’s Lord.\n\nSeraphim, in the heights of heaven, called\nIn anguish: “This is then the Law, and this\nThe wage thereof, O Thou who spreadest out\nLight as a garment! Thus the foe blasphemes\nThy great and awful Name, and scorns Thy Law!”\nBut out of Heaven’s height a voice replied:\n“Let no sound more be uttered, lest I turn\nThe world to water, and My throne’s footstool\nTo sudden chaos. This is My decree;\nAccept it, all of you who loved the Law\nWhich I created ere the world was made.”\nThus were the princes of the Law brought low,\nThe corner-stones jeweled with precepts. Now\nRabbi Akiba was led forth to die;\nHananya, too, who was Teradyon’s son,\nTorn from his place; and yet he held the scroll\nFast in his arms.—O God, blot out their pain.\nMourn, O my people, not yet widowed;—still\nAs in a vision, for a worthless whim\nI see your holiest slaughtered; see their blood\nShed in the Name of Heaven—as even now\nThe blood of Huspith the Interpreter.\nTrembling takes hold on all who hear, and tears\nFlow from all eyes, and all delight is dead;\nFor Eliezer falls, Shamua’s son.\nHow have our strong oppressors fed on us!\nHow do they give us water of gall to drink—\nSlaying Hanina, son of Hakinai!\n\nThey will not take a ransom, they must take\nThe lives of those who speak the Law’s sweet words,\nYea, even now the Scribe Yeshebab’s life.\nSons of unrerason strike us with their fear\nMore than the kings of earth; they slay of us\nMany and many; verily they cast\nJudah, the son of Dama, unto death!\nAh, Thou has said, Jacob shall be a fire,\nJoseph a flame—lo, the last ashes die.\nO bring the burning of the day of doom,\nFor Judah, son of Baba, is not spared.\nHere were ten righteous men; lo, they are slain.\n\nThis hath befallen us. All this I tell\nAs I beheld it passing through the years\nOf bygone ages. And subdued and crushed,\nWe pour our hearts out supplicating Thee.\nLord, Lord, give ear; O pitying, merciful,\nLook from Thine height upon the blood outpoured\nOf all Thy righteous. Make an end of blood\nPoured out and wasted; wash the stain away,\nGod, King, who sittest on a gracious Throne.",

This poem, published in 1842, is a revision of Whitman’s first published poem “Our Future Lot,” from 1838. In that 20-line poem, similar wording includes: “With flashing hope, and gloomy fear” (line 2); “The troubled heart and wondrous form / Must both alike decay (lines 7-8); “Dull senseless limbs, and ashy face, / But where, O Nature! where will be / My mind’s abiding place?

The kids\nwere hungry until we GIs fed them. We dusted them with DDT. Hardly done. Reha-\nbilitation of Korea, that is. It needs chemical fertilizer from the States, power to build\nthings like a country. In the end it was the hardliest of wars made up of bubble gum,\nwhich GIs had to show those kids how to chew. In no circumstance whatever can\nman be comfortable without art. They don’t want everlasting charity, and we are not\ngiving it to them. We are just lending them a hand until they can stand on their own\ntwo feet. A novel idea. This is why it occurred to me that this particular war was\nhardly war, the hardliest of wars.\n\n\n\nMy father was hardly himself during the war, then I was born during the era that\nhardly existed, and, therefore, I hardly existed without DDT. Beauty is pleasure re-\ngarded as the quality of a thing. I prefer a paper closet with real paper dresses in\nit. To be born hardly, hardly after the hardliest of wars, is a matter of debate. Still\ngoing forward. We are, that is. Napalm again. This is THE BIG PICTURE. War and its\nmasses. War and its men. War and its machines. Together we form THE BIG PIC-\nTURE. From Korea to Germany, from Alaska to Puerto Rico. All over the world, the\nUS Army is on the alert to defend our country, you the people, against aggression.\nThis is THE BIG PICTURE, an official television report to the nation from the army.\nThis is Korea! Is one thing better than another? These South Koreans are all right.\nWoe is you, woe is war, hardly war, woe is me, woe are you? My father is still alive,\nand this is how I came to prefer a paper closet with real paper dresses in it.\n\n\n\nWell, it’s morning in Korea. The most violently mountainous place on Earth. Every-\none has been dusted, existence hardly done, whereas beauty has been regarded as\nthe quality of a thing. At Uncle Dann’s Huddle doughnuts and coffee are free and in\ncase there are any, for there are many, the unescorted ladies are not permitted. The\ndecision has been made in Tokyo for the hardliest of wars, an old soldier made it.\nThe situation in Korea is so critical that we the Navy must give the Eighth Army prac-\ntical support.

    "text": "Do not a civilization make. Do they? Cozy up to the fleece of a sheep, take the lid off Elizabeth Bishop’s head and get a spoon. Do not eat yet; do not swoon. There will be hours for that. First there is a long war march. Then there are other animals to press into the barn before the lightning storm comes to cook the grass and rinse it and make a mess. But this is all outside and you need never go there. Can you ride a tin? Yes, you can, says the child detective. The poet lies under the sheep, reading of Robert Menzies, his wife Pattie, and their pets. “We had a lovely weekend,” they tell reporters. Just months later their cat’s dead. Robert turns from the golden syrup, while deciding whether to use a knife or a spoon, the television on though it’s only 8\nam\n. Elizabeth was reading her poetry aloud into a woolly microphone. She thought she saw the top of Robert’s head pass by the window.\nShe was thinking of the story “Marmosets” she was translating, by Clarice Lispector. A spirit moved out of the shadows and found an unopened tin in the cupboard and threw it at the window, causing the monkeys on the verandah to flee from the glass. You can hear it on the recording at PennSound. A shearer found glass in a sheep’s fleece months later. “Lucky.” “Why lucky?” “Lucky it didn’t take your thumb off.” That was what Bishop heard about it. She wanted something to give to Clarice. Something in wool or a painting. She saw the earth tipping up, as if she was falling over while looking out the window, and she was traveling to Australia via a flying tin of golden syrup, where there were sheep all ready to cushion her, but it wasn’t necessary for she fell into the arms of the Prime Minister. “Tilted space age pastoral,” she thought, but “marmoset” was what she murmured up at him. He could hear his wife crying that their cat was dead. “It was bloody ASIO!” she bawled. Saying sorry, he dropped the unexpected visitor on the lawn and went to his wife’s aid. He spread one of the scones he’d baked earlier and made a fresh pot. “I don’t want any of that ASIO muck,” Pattie grizzled. Robert turned to Elizabeth to see if she could hear, ready to explain how upset his wife was. Elizabeth had found a curious black spread in the cupboard and was helping herself. “That’s not food,” baa’d the sheep detective. Lightning struck where they’d been sitting just minutes before. “Life is not flat, that’s for sure,” Elizabeth thought to herself, remembering the sheep in the window back home, and starting to write a poem. It would be about flying through the air, and strange food, and the floury arms of a patriarch.",

She made him some baked chicken with potatoes and gravy and some kind of greens\n—not collards, but they still looked real good. Everything looked so delicious, I just wanted to reach into that television and snatch a plate for myself.\nHe gave her a kiss and then a voice came on saying He'll love you for it and then the commercial went off.\n\nI sat on Miss Edna's scratchy couch wondering if that man and woman really ate that food or just threw it all away.\n\nNow Ms. Marcus wants to know why I wrote that the lady is white and I say because it's true. And Ms. Marcus says Lonnie, what does race have to do with it, forgetting that she asked us to use lots of details when we wrote. Forgetting that whole long talk she gave yesterday about the importance of description! I don't say anything back to her, just look down at my arm. It's dark brown and there's a scab by my wrist that I don't pick at if I remember not to. I look at my knuckles. They're real dark too.\n\nOutside it's starting to rain and the way the rain comes down\n—\ntap, tapping against the window\n—gets me to thinking. Ms. Marcus don't understand some things even though she's my favorite teacher in the world. Things like my brown, brown arm. And the white lady and man with all that good food to throw away. How if you turn on your TV, that's what you see\n—people with lots and lots of stuff not having to sit on scratchy couches in Miss Edna's house. And the true fact is alotta those people are white. Maybe it's that if you're white you can't see all the whiteness around you.",

No one here has a rifle\nbut the wind turns abruptly and returns a report.\n\nThree bright orange vests hang at the ready.\nThe doe turns in her frame above the stove,\n\nand her season climbs like the moon into its place\nin the sky’s clock.

When I bend to stack\nthe splits, my breasts pop and burn,\n\nand my child’s face rises like a bird\nrazoring its shadow over the snow.\n\nWind takes the rag of some old self\nand shakes it at me. The heart is only\n\nanother shape the view stretches to include.\nBirches march out of the hardwoods\n\nwith their white waists radiant, so many\nclones on one taproot. A jay circles\n\nthe full feeders fending off smaller birds.\nI make this vocal gesture because self\n\nis simply one edge of me. Out here\nthere’s only an economy of wood burned\n\nor to be burned, how much water’s left\nin the tank, how hard or soft the light.\n\nDegrees and drafts. This room and everything in it\nare mine, and though I try to be selfish and grim,\n\nmy child has made me enduringly plural,\nmore than I, but not quite we.\n\nBlack-capped chickadees flee\nfrom three big jays at the feeder. Shrieking\n\nand diving in the strong winter light, the jays\nare not actually blue. Their feathers refract light\n\nso they appear blue. Self-luminous,\nhardy and belligerent as pronouns.\n\n\nIII.Easter\n\nThe kick of the screw finding purchase in pine\nslams my wrist bone, elbow and shoulder,\nbut it’s in, and the panel is up. Now another\nand another until the wall is flush. I mark\n\nand cut each length with the small tooth\nof the new jigsaw my husband thought\nI should have. Two days apart from him\nand the child, I’ve forgotten the pump\n\nto empty my breasts, so the saw’s jump\nat the end of the cut draws the burning\nup. And with it a guilt as bright as the room\nwhere I drive plank after plank against the studs,\n\neach a satisfaction against the body’s wish\nto be elsewhere. Even into the night, I can’t put\ndown my drill. I stoke the fire and drive\nmore screws, loving the growl when they’re\n\nin as far as they’ll go.

    "text": "The unsympathetic wind, how she has evaded me for years now,\nleaving a guileless shell and no way to navigate. Once when I stood\non a plateau of earth just at the moment before the dangerous,\njutting peaks converged upon the lilting sway of grasslands, I almost\nfound a way back. There, the sky, quite possibly all the elements,\ncaused the rock and soil and vegetation to congregate. Their prayer\nwas not new and so faint I could hardly discern. Simple remembrances,\nlike a tiny, syncopated chorus calling everyone home: across\na thousand eastward miles, and what little wind was left at my back.\nBut I could not move. And then the music was gone.\nAll that was left were the spring time faces of mountains, gazing down,\ntheir last patches of snow, luminous. I dreamed of becoming snow melt,\ngliding down the slope and in to the valley. With the promise,\nan assurance, that there is always a way to become bird, tree, water again.",

One by one,\nThey took their places until thousands met;\nNo leader’s stars flashed on before, and none\nLeaned on his sword or stagger’d with his gun—\nI wonder if their feet have rested yet!\n\nThey saw the dust, they joined the moving mass,\nThey answer’d the fierce music’s cry for blood,\nThen straggled here and lay down in the grass:—\nWear flowers for such, shores whence their feet did pass;\nSing tenderly; O river’s haunted flood!\n\nThey had been sick, and worn, and weary, when\nThey stopp’d on this calm hill beneath the trees:\nYet if, in some red-clouded dawn, again\nThe country should be calling to her men,\nShall the r[e]veill[e] not remember these?\n\nAround them underneath the mid-day skies\nThe dreadful phantoms of the living walk,\nAnd by low moons and darkness with their cries—\nThe mothers, sisters, wives with faded eyes,\nWho call still names amid their broken talk.\n\nAnd there is one who comes alone and stands\nAt his dim fireless hearth—chill’d and oppress’d\nBy Something he had summon’d to his lands,\nWhile the weird pallor of its many hands\nPoints to his rusted sword in his own breast!",
